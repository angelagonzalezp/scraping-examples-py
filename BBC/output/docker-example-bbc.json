I think he wants to make a deal for me. You understand that? As crazy as that sounds,\" Trump told Macron, appearing to refer to Putin.\nIt remains to be seen how straightforward it will be to bring two such bitter enemies face-to-face at the negotiating table for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\nFor months, Zelensky has been pushing to meet Putin, although this was likely a way of proving his argument that Russia is not serious about pursuing peace, as he believed the Kremlin had no interest in such a meeting.\nMoscow has repeatedly turned down the idea of a Putin-Zelensky sit-down.\nA noncommittal statement from Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov on Monday night said it was \"worthwhile\" to \"explore the possibility of raising the level of representatives\" from the Russian and Ukrainian delegations in negotiations.\nTrump seemed to dismiss the need for any ceasefire before negotiations to end the war can take place.\nIn the past, that has been a key demand of Ukraine, which made clear it sees an end to the fighting as a prerequisite for further talks with Russia and, ultimately, for a longer-term settlement.\nA ceasefire could also be marginally easier to agree than a full peace deal, which would take many months of negotiations, during which Russia's assault on Ukraine would probably continue.\n\"I don't know that it's necessary,\" Trump said of a ceasefire.\nBut the European leaders appeared to push back, with the strongest rebuttal coming from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\n\"I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire,\" Merz said. \"So, let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia.\"\nWhen asked to speak, Zelensky did not reiterate his previous calls for a ceasefire to be put in place.\nTrump told Zelensky the US would help guarantee Ukraine's security in any deal to end the war, without specifying the extent of any assistance.\nThe US president did not offer boots on the ground.

including the areas where most of its 2.1 million Palestinian residents have sought refuge - after indirect talks with Hamas on a ceasefire deal broke down last month.\nOn Monday night, a Hamas statement announced that the armed group and other Palestinian factions had approved a ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators to their delegations in Cairo the previous day.\nHamas official Taher al-Nunu told Al-Araby TV that they had not sought any amendments to the proposal, which he described as \"a partial deal leading to a comprehensive deal\".\nHe also emphasised that on the first day of its implementation, negotiations would begin with the aim of agreeing a permanent ceasefire.\nQatar's foreign ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari, told reporters in Doha on Tuesday that the proposal was \"98%\" similar to the one presented by US envoy Steve Witkoff in June.\n\"It is within the confines of the Witkoff plan... It's a continuation of that process. Obviously, it's in the details where the devil lies,\" Ansari said.\nWitkoff proposed a 60-day truce that would see Hamas release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages on days one and seven, in exchange for 125 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails, 1,111 detainees from Gaza and the bodies of 180 Gazans.\nIsrael accepted Witkoff's plan, but Hamas rejected it, partly because it did not include a guarantee that the temporary ceasefire would lead to a permanent one.\nA Palestinian official told the BBC that the Egyptian and Qatari proposal would see Hamas release eight living hostages on day one and two more on day 50. Five dead hostages would be handed over on day seven, five more on day 30, and another eight on day 60.\nIn return, Israel would release 1,500 detainees from Gaza as well as 150 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 50 others serving terms longer than 15 years, the official said.\nIsraeli forces would also withdraw to areas of Gaza located between 800m and 1.2km (0.5-0.75 miles) from the perimeter with Israel during the truce, but would remain stationed in the Morag and Philadelphi military corridors in the south of the territory, the official added.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, an Egyptian source familiar with the negotiations told the BBC that the mediators had not yet received a formal response from Israel to the new proposal.\nHowever, the official in Prime Minister Netanyahu's office told Israeli journalists: \"Israel's policy remains consistent and unchanged. Israel demands the release of all 50 hostages in accordance with the principles set by the cabinet to end the war.\"\n\"We are in the final stage of defeating Hamas and will not leave any hostage behind.\"\nAlthough the statement was not an explicit rejection of the proposal, it does suggest that Israel may want to negotiate further.\nOn Saturday night, Prime Minister Netanyahu's office put out a similar statement saying that Israel would only \"agree to a deal on condition that all the hostages are released in one go\"  and that the conditions for ending the war included the disarming of Hamas, the demilitarisation of Gaza, Israeli control of the Gaza perimeter, and the installation of non-Hamas and non-Palestinian Authority governance.\nNetanyahu said in a video on Monday that he had discussed with senior Israeli military commanders their \"plans regarding Gaza City and the completion of our missions\".\n\"Like you, I hear the reports in the media, and from them you can get one impression - Hamas is under immense pressure,\" he added.\nThe prime minister himself faces pressure from his far-right coalition partners who want to keep the war going until Hamas's defeat and then annex Gaza.\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Israel must not accept a partial deal \"that abandons half of the hostages and that could lead to the suspension of the war in defeat\".\n\"It is forbidden to surrender and give a lifeline to the enemy,\" he added.\nHostages' families and a majority of the Israeli public meanwhile want Netanyahu to agree a deal with Hamas to end the war now and bring all the hostages home.\n\"About a month ago, we were closer than ever to signing a deal.

The quiet murmuring of voices from the film playing on her screen helped her to drift off on a packed overnight flight.\nBut two hours before landing, Kelly - whose name has been changed for this article - was woken by the man sitting next to her, sexually assaulting her.\nThe man in his 60s has now been jailed but Kelly is finding it difficult to go on with her day-to-day life and is locked in a battle for compensation.\nSpeaking about the ordeal for the first time, she tells the BBC the man had pulled a second blanket over both of them before the attack.\n\"His hands were down my trousers and I said to him, 'What are you doing?' I said, 'Stop'. He said, 'No, please'. And I had to force his hand out of my trousers and that just made me get up straight away. I left my phone, I left my bag, I left my passport, I left everything. I left my shoes and ran into the toilet, left the door open [and] told the flight attendant,\" she says.\nKelly was initially moved to a cabin crew seat before being moved elsewhere in the cabin until landing.\n\"I had to endure the rest of the plane journey, which was awful,\" Kelly remembers. \"I was so anxious\u2026 anyone that walked by I would instantly panic because I thought it would be him.\"\nMomade Jussab, 66, was arrested as soon as the flight arrived into Gatwick. He was subsequently charged with one count of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual assault, and was found guilty after a trial in March. He is now serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence.\nAlthough Kelly is pleased he has been convicted, she said the impact of the assault on her has been severe.\n\"I haven't been out in almost a year - to events or summer parties with my friends. I can't do that. I'm too scared. I don't want to be touched or looked at. So it's never leaving me. It's literally there every single day before I sleep, I'm thinking about what happened.\"\nKelly is now fighting for compensation under the government's Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS).\nThe scheme compensates people who have been physically or mentally injured as a result of a violent crime. According to CICS guidance, compensation can be awarded to victims of sexual or physical abuse.\nBut when Kelly applied to the scheme for compensation in April her application was refused.\nA letter from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) - which processes applications on behalf of the Ministry of Justice - said the offence did not occur in a \"relevant place\" as defined by the scheme. She appealed against the decision but in May was refused again.\nThe current rules of the scheme state an aircraft is only considered a \"relevant place\" if it is a British-registered aircraft within the meaning of section 92 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. Kelly was told as the offence occurred on a Qatari-registered aircraft, she was ineligible for compensation. She believes this is unfair.\n\"I understand that he's been sentenced and he's done what he's done and he's paying the price for that. But what about me? I can't afford certain therapy,\" Kelly said. \"I just want to be compensated for what I've been through. I want professional help and I want to be heard.\"\nHer lawyers at the firm Leigh Day argue the decision is \"irrational\".\nIn 1996, the Civil Aviation Act was changed so that crimes committed on foreign planes bound for the UK could be prosecuted in UK criminal courts. This change meant that Jussab could be arrested and charged when the Qatar Airways flight landed at Gatwick last autumn.\nBut victims in these cases still cannot claim compensation.\nLeigh Day wants the change to also apply to the CICS scheme so that people like Kelly can successfully apply for compensation.\nIt is calling on Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood to close what it calls a gap in the law.\n\"Under the current scheme, it appears that a violent sexual assault on a British-registered aircraft is eligible for compensation while a victim of the same violent assault on a foreign registered aircraft - on a UK-bound flight where the perpetrator is prosecuted under UK law - is excluded,\" Leigh Day's Claire Powell said.\nShe called for this to be changed urgently \"in light of this government's commitment to addressing violence against women and girls\".\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts remain with this victim, and we remain resolute in our mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade.\n\"The rules that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority follows, and the values of payments for injuries, are set by Parliament. Other routes are available for victims to receive support.\"\nAs well as her fight for compensation, Kelly says she is speaking out to persuade women to be aware of their surroundings, and of others, while travelling on public transport, especially when alone.\n\"Please be aware.

The church's move is the most spectacular and symbolic moment of the wider relocation of buildings in Kiruna, which lies 145km north of the Arctic Circle.\nThe journey began with a blessing from the church's vicar, Lena Tj\u00e4rnberg, and Bishop \u00c5sa Nystr\u00f6m of the Diocese of Lule\u00e5.\nAs the short ceremony ended, engines rumbled to life and the massive wooden church began inching forward. In the first hour, it managed just 30m, the trailers' wheels slowly turning under its weight.\nLarge crowds lined the streets under clear blue skies, watching in awe as the timber structure rolled forward. Safety barriers kept people back, but the building passed so close that many said it felt as though they could almost reach out and touch it.\n\"It's a big crowd. People came not just from Kiruna and other parts of Sweden. I heard many different languages being spoken,\" said culture strategist Sofia Lagerl\u00f6f M\u00e4tt\u00e4\u00e4. \"It's like history taking place in front of our eyes.\"\nThe man in charge of the move, project manager Stefan Holmblad Johansson, said: \"It's a historic event, a very big and complex operation and we don't have a margin of error. But everything is under control.\"\nBy the mid-2010s, other buildings in Kiruna were already being shifted to safer ground. Most were demolished and rebuilt, but some landmarks were moved intact.\nThese include buildings in Hjalmar Lundbohmsg\u00e5rden such as the so-called yellow row of three old wooden houses and the former home of mining manager Hjalmar Lundbohm, which was split into three parts.\nThe clock tower on the roof of the old city hall was also moved and can now be found next to the new city hall.\nUnder Swedish law, mining activity cannot take place under buildings.\nRobert Ylitalo, chief executive officer of Kiruna's development company, explained: \"There's no risk of people falling through cracks. But fissures would eventually damage the water, electricity and sewage supply. People have to move before the infrastructure fails.\"\nThe iron ore mine's operator, LKAB - also Kiruna's biggest employer - is covering the city's relocation bill, estimated at more than 10bn Swedish krona ($1bn; \u00a3737m).\nKiruna Church is 35m (115ft) high, 40m wide and weighs 672 tonnes.  It was once voted Sweden's most beautiful pre-1950 building.\nRelocating such a large building is an unusual feat. But instead of dismantling it, engineers are moving it in one piece, supported by steel beams and carried on self-propelled modular transporters.\n\"The biggest challenge was preparing the road for such a wide building,\" said Mr Johansson.\n\"We've widened it to 24 metres (79ft) and along the way we removed lamp-posts, traffic lights as well as a bridge that was slated for demolition anyway.\"\nAmong the onlookers were Lena Edkvist and her husband, who had driven from Gothenburg.\n\"I'm not a deeply religious person - I only go to church on special occasions. But this is part of my tradition, history and culture,\" she said. \"It feels like an honour that they're moving it intact instead of dismantling it piece by piece.\"\nFor Kjell Olovsson, project manager at Veidekke, the contractor leading the relocation, the moment brought calm satisfaction.\n\"After years of preparation, we're finally moving. I'm thrilled and just enjoying the moment.

From what Sir Keir said overnight, it seems he believes that small sacrifice was well worth it.\nHe co-chaired a virtual meeting of European and Commonwealth allies, the coalition of the willing, on Tuesday to update leaders and to discuss next steps.\nFollowing the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had outlined plans for the coalition and US counterparts to meet in the coming days to prepare for the deployment of a \"reassurance force\" if hostilities were to end.\nThe leaders also discussed how further pressure could be placed on Putin, including through sanctions.\nSeparately, Trump told Fox News that Ukraine was \"not going to be a part of Nato\", the military treaty of western nations, but suggested that European troops would be in Ukraine to deter any future Russian attack.\n\"Some of them, France and Germany, a couple of them, the UK - they are going to have boots on the ground,\" he said.\nSir Keir has long been a proponent of so-called gratitude diplomacy - thanking and praising Trump - so he was hardly likely to be critical about the outcomes.\nAnd while anxiety in UK government circles about Ukraine's future remains, the prime minister seems happy with what he argues is significant progress.\nHe told the BBC after the White House summit that it \"has shown that we have moved forward\".\nBehind the scenes, European officials had worried the White House meeting was fraught with risk.\nOne told me they felt there was a danger of President Trump sensing President Zelensky was not committed to a US-led peace process, concluding that European leaders were digging in behind the Ukrainians, and making his frustration clear on camera.\nSuch division would have been a gift to Moscow so all the leaders involved were at pains to make clear that was not their approach.\nBefore he left Washington, Sir Keir said there was \"a real sense ofunity\"between them.\nThe prime minister told the BBC he was \"very pleased\" with the outcomes, including progress on security guarantees, saying this would \"reassure people in Europe, in Ukraine, but particularly in the United Kingdom\".\nHe also welcomed the \"real movement forward\" on bilateral and trilateral meetings between Russia, Ukraine and the US, saying this would help achieve a \"peace that is lasting and just\".\nUkraine and Europe's leaders have clearly decided together to go all in on Trump's peace plans.\nThe assessment of diplomats from various countries involved is that if the process ultimately fails, they will not have contributed to that failure.\n\nThe UK government now seems focused on ensuring Ukraine is in the strongest possible position for any possible peace negotiations.\nFrom my conversations with UK officials, they believe Monday's White House meeting was helpful in this effort on two points.\nFirstly, Trump did not echo Putin's demands for Ukrainian territory and put Zelensky on the spot on what is a sensitive and emotive issue - at least in front of the cameras.\nThere now seems to be an unspoken acceptance in the White House that Ukraine will need to move carefully and slowly on any discussions over land. No 10 has repeatedly said that questions of territory are a matter for Ukraine, and Ukraine alone.\n\"No decision should be made about Ukraine without Ukraine,\" the prime minister stressed after Monday's talks.\nSecondly, flexibility is important in any negotiation. UK officials argue that Trump's commitment to US involvement in \"cast iron\" security guarantees means Zelensky can now be far more flexible in his approach knowing that Ukraine will be protected by its allies.\nProspects of a pre-negotiation ceasefire seem to have been junked. Trump has dismissed the need for ceasefire and wants to move directly to agreeing peace terms.\nThe importance of having a ceasefire was mentioned in the White House talks by the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe UK's assessment is that a ceasefire was never a central aim of the US administration and therefore Sir Keir should not risk being what one source called a \"lone point of tension\" on the issue.\nThe prime minister has returned to the UK, but military officials - including the chief of defence staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin - are travelling in the opposite direction ahead of detailed discussions about US involvement in security guarantees.\nFrom the outset, Sir Keir has said any deal would require a strong US \"backstop\".\nTrump has yet to provide much detail on what US forces might offer, but European leaders seem content to take his public commitment as important progress.\nThe major unknown is what Moscow will do next.\nOne involved argues Putin could retreat from the pathway towards peace that has been created for him.

Now stuck in a situation far beyond their control, the crew wants a quick resolution.\nHe says the owner and Indian shipping officials keep asking us for one more day to resolve the crisis but nothing promising has come out yet.\n\"This is a war zone. All we want is to return home quickly,\" he told the BBC.\nIndia is the second-largest supplier of sailors and crew of commercial ships globally.\nBut it also tops the list of crew members known as \"abandoned seafarers\" - a term used by 2006 Maritime Labour Convention to describe the situation when shipowners sever ties with the crew and fail to provide them for repatriation, regular provisions and wages.\nAccording to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), which represents seafarers globally, there were 3,133 abandoned sailors across 312 ships in 2024 - of which Indian nationals accounted for 899.\nFor many, leaving the ship without a salary is not possible - especially if they have already paid hefty sums to agents for landing the job or for acquiring training certifications, Mohammad Gulam Ansari, a former seafarer who helps repatriate Indian crew from other parts of the world, tells the BBC.\nThe most significant reason for abandonment is the widespread practice of registering ships - called flags of convenience - in countries that have weak shipping rules, according to ITF.\nInternational maritime rules allow a ship to be registered or flagged in a country different from its owners.\n\"A country can set up a ship registry and charge fees to shipowners, while having reduced standards for crew safety and welfare and often failing to live up to the responsibilities of a genuine flag state,\" the ITF website states.\nThis system, the group says, also obscures the identity of the real owner, which helps dubious owners ply ships.\nITF data shows that in 2024, around 90% of the abandoned vessels sailed under a flag of convenience.\nBut complications arise also because of the globalised nature of the shipping industry, with owners, managers, flags and crews of the ship often coming from different countries, industry observers say.\nOn 9 January 2025, Captain Amitabh Chaudhary* was steering a cargo vessel from Iraq to the United Arab Emirates when bad weather forced him to make a slight detour.\nMinutes later, Tanzania-flagged Stratos vessel hit rocks underneath and damaged its oil-laden tank, forcing an unplanned stall near Saudi Arabia's Jubail port.\nThe crew - including nine Indians and one Iraqi - made several attempts to float it again but they failed.\nStuck, they waited there for help for nearly six months before the ship was refloated.\nThe ship's Iraqi owner, meanwhile, refused to pay their salaries citing losses incurred due to the stalled vessel, Mr Chaudhary told the BBC.\nThe BBC reached out to the owners of the ship for a response to these allegations but they didn't respond.\nSeafarers often blame India's maritime regulator, Directorate General (DG) of Shipping - which is tasked with verifying the credentials of ships, their owners and recruitment and placement agencies - for lax scrutiny of stakeholders. The DG Shipping didn't respond to a request for comment.\nOthers, however, point out that even the crew needs to be more vigilant.\n\"When you are hired, you get enough time to inform the DG Shipping [about any discrepancies in your contract],\" said Sushil Deorukhkar, an ITF representative working for the welfare of the seafarers. \"Once you sign the papers, you are stuck and have to knock on every door for resolution.\"\nThings can get complicated even for the crew on Indian-owned ships operating within the country's waters for a variety of reasons.\nCaptain Prabjeet Singh was employed on Nirvana, an Indian-owned, Curacao-flagged oil tanker, with 22 other Indian crew members. It had recently been sold to a new owner, who wanted it decommissioned, and their salary was under dispute between the new and old owners.\nIn early April, Mr Singh was taking it to a port in western India's Gujarat state for dismantling when an Indian court ordered its seizure \"for non-payment of crew\", according to the ILO-IMO database.\nWithin days, the crew realised they were abandoned, Mr Singh said. \"We were without adequate food and provisions. The ship had run out of diesel and was in complete blackout,\" Mr Singh told the BBC. \"We were forced to break and burn the ship's wood to cook food.\"\nHired in October 2024, Mr Singh had hoped to earn a decent living with this job, and that is why leaving the ship without salary was not a viable option for him.\nThe crew could finally disembark on 7 July after a court-ordered settlement. But the crew's wages remain unpaid despite the court order, according to the ILO-IMO database.\nBack in the Gulf, the crew of Stratos said their biggest fear was that the hole in the ship's bottom would sink it.\nBut the immediate challenge, they found, was hunger.\n\"For days, we had to eat only rice or potatoes because there were no supplies,\" Mr Chaudhary told the BBC last week.\nAfter nearly six months, the crew finally managed to float the ship back - but the accident had left its rudder damaged, making it unfit to sail.\nThe crew are still at the ship waiting for their salaries to be paid.\n\"We are still at the same place in the same situation.

The full terms of the deal, which still needs to be ratified by union members, have not been disclosed, but the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) said it achieves \"transformational change\" for workers and the industry.\nIt also advised its members to \"fully co-operate with the resumption of operations.\"\nHere's what you need to know as Air Canada prepares to fly again.\nAir Canada said it will \"gradually restart operations\" on Tuesday after reaching an agreement with the union that will bring 10,000 flight attendants back to work.\nThe first flights are scheduled to take off Tuesday evening, but the company will need about a week to resume full service, it added.\nOver the next seven to 10 days, some flights will be cancelled \"until the schedule is stabilised\", the airline said in a statement.\nAir Canada advised that only passengers with confirmed bookings should head to the airport.\nThose with cancelled flights will still be able to get a full refund or credit for future travel, it added, or be rebooked on another airline.\nAfter nine hours of negotiations, with help of a mediator, the two sides reached a tentative agreement early Tuesday morning. Neither CUPE or Air Canada have said yet what is in that agreement, but there are some hints.\nWe know that a major sticking point for the union was what flight attendants called \"unpaid work\". They wanted to change the compensation system, which only covered the hours they were in the air, to also pay them for time in the airport, when they guide boarding or wait for flights.\nCUPE, in its statement on the deal, said \"unpaid work is over\".\nThe agreement will still have to be voted on by union members.\nAir Canada said it will not comment on the agreement until \"ratification is complete.\"\nIt added that during the voting process, \"a strike or lockout is not possible.\"\nFlight attendants gave a 72-hour strike notice last week after months-long contract talks reached an impasse. Soon afterwards, Air Canada began delaying and cancelling some flights.\nBy Saturday, Air Canada said it was forced to suspend \"all operations\" after workers voted to go on strike.\nWith the strike in effect, the airline announced it would halt flights on its Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge service.\nAir Canada Express flights, which carry about 20% of Air Canada's daily customers, were not affected.\nAir Canada said the strike has impacted half of a million passengers. The airline operates around 700 flights daily, both domestically and internationally.\nCUPE said the company was not addressing key issues such as wages and unpaid work.\nIt said it bargained in good faith with the airline for more than eight months.\nBefore the strike, the airline said it had offered flight attendants a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, with a 25% raise in the first year.\nBut the union said the offer was \"below inflation, below market value, below minimum wage\" and would leave flight attendants unpaid for some hours of work.\nThey said wages had not kept up with inflation, so Air Canada's suggested pay increase was \"in effect, a pay cut\".\nAlmost all of the attendants - 99.7% - voted to strike earlier this month. The company asked the government to intervene.\nAs the cancellations mounted, the Canadian government used its powers to force the airline and the union into binding arbitration, hoping to minimise disruptions for travel and the economy.\n\"Despite significant supports from the government, these parties have been unable to resolve their differences in a timely manner,\" Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said on Saturday, in invoking Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code.\n\"I am exercising this authority because it is critical to maintaining and securing industrial peace, protecting Canadians and promoting conditions to resolve the dispute.\"\nThe Canada Industrial Relations Board then issued a return-to-work order, which the union defied.\nCUPE accused the federal government of violating the rights of striking workers. They alleged that forcing an end to the strike would \"ensure unresolved issues will continue to worsen by kicking them down the road\".\nIn binding arbitration, an independent third party sets the terms of a contract in an agreement that is legally enforceable.\nAfter the union's refusal to return to work, Hajdu released a statement on Monday encouraging Air Canada and CUPE to resume negotiations.\nShe added that her ministry will order a probe into \"the allegations of unpaid work in the airline sector\".\nAir Canada has said it will notify passengers if there is a change to the flight's scheduled departure time.\nCustomers whose flights are cancelled will be notified and will receive a full refund, the airline said, or can receive flight credits for future bookings.\nThe company has also made arrangements with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide customers alternative travel options, though it cautioned that space on other airlines will be limited \"due to the peak summer travel season.\"\nIf it's a round trip, return flights are not automatically cancelled in case the passenger reaches the destination.\nThose bookings can be cancelled with no fees.", "tags": ["Companies", "Trade Unions", "Travel", "Transport", "Air travel", "Canada"]}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2vz9jg8jzo", "headline": "Why scientists hope seabed mud could reveal Antarctic Ocean secrets", "author": "Victoria Gill", "body": "Why would anyone brave hand-numbing cold, icy winds and rough seas - sometimes working through the night - to dig up mud from the Antarctic seabed?\nThat is what an international team of particularly adventurous researchers did earlier this year in the remote Antarctic Peninsula, on a mission aiming to reveal centuries of scientific secrets about the Southern Ocean.\nScientists around the world will now share and analyse these precious mud samples to work out how human activity - including a century of industrial whaling -  affected Antarctica and the rest of our planet.\nThe research is part of a global effort to understand the relationship between the ocean and the climate.\nResearchers used a special coring drill - a bit like a huge apple-corer - tethered to a research ship, to drill at depths of up to 500m.\nThey collected more than 40 long cores, or tubes, of seafloor sediment from locations around the peninsula.\nThis is one of the richest habitats for marine life in Antarctica, and a focal point for fishing, tourism and - before it was banned in the 1980s - industrial whale hunting.\nCollecting the sediment gives insight and clues to the past, \"like a book of history\", explained lead researcher Dr Elisenda Balleste from the University of Barcelona.\n\"What is living in the seas now, what was living in the seas in the past and evidence of our human impact\" is recorded in layer upon layer of sediment over centuries, she said.\nBy preserving and dating those layers, and analysing what they contain, researchers can build a picture of the history of Antarctic marine life.\nOnce on board the ship, the cores were frozen and transported to Barcelona and Dr Balleste's laboratory.\nFrom there, carefully extracted pieces of this Antarctic mud will be sent out to several academic institutions around the world.\nScientists will scan and date the sediment layers, work out what microbial life they contain, measure levels of pollution and calculate how much carbon is buried in the mud.\nIt is part of a mission - theConvex Seascape Survey- which involves universities and research institutions around the globe working together to better understand how our ocean and climate are connected.\nClaire Allen, an oceanographer from the British Antarctic Survey who has studied Antarctica's past for more than 20 years, said that cores like these were particularly valuable.\n\"Before 1950 - before there was any kind of monitoring capacity in Antarctica - sediment cores and ice cores are the only way that we can get an insight into any of the climatic or physical properties that have changed over time,\" she said.\nThe newly collected samples being stored for DNA analysis have to be kept at temperatures low enough to stop all biological processes.\nDr Balleste took them out of the industrial-sized freezer where they are being stored to show them to us, very briefly.\n\"They're kept at minus 80 degrees to stop them degrading,\" she explained.\nThese small pieces of the seabed - frozen in time at temperatures that preserve genetic material - will be used for what is known as environmental DNA analysis.\nIt is an area of science which has developed rapidly in recent years.

The quiet murmuring of voices from the film playing on her screen helped her to drift off on a packed overnight flight.\nBut two hours before landing, Kelly - whose name has been changed for this article - was woken by the man sitting next to her, sexually assaulting her.\nThe man in his 60s has now been jailed but Kelly is finding it difficult to go on with her day-to-day life and is locked in a battle for compensation.\nSpeaking about the ordeal for the first time, she tells the BBC the man had pulled a second blanket over both of them before the attack.\n\"His hands were down my trousers and I said to him, 'What are you doing?' I said, 'Stop'. He said, 'No, please'. And I had to force his hand out of my trousers and that just made me get up straight away. I left my phone, I left my bag, I left my passport, I left everything. I left my shoes and ran into the toilet, left the door open [and] told the flight attendant,\" she says.\nKelly was initially moved to a cabin crew seat before being moved elsewhere in the cabin until landing.\n\"I had to endure the rest of the plane journey, which was awful,\" Kelly remembers. \"I was so anxious\u2026 anyone that walked by I would instantly panic because I thought it would be him.\"\nMomade Jussab, 66, was arrested as soon as the flight arrived into Gatwick. He was subsequently charged with one count of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual assault, and was found guilty after a trial in March. He is now serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence.\nAlthough Kelly is pleased he has been convicted, she said the impact of the assault on her has been severe.\n\"I haven't been out in almost a year - to events or summer parties with my friends. I can't do that. I'm too scared. I don't want to be touched or looked at. So it's never leaving me. It's literally there every single day before I sleep, I'm thinking about what happened.\"\nKelly is now fighting for compensation under the government's Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS).\nThe scheme compensates people who have been physically or mentally injured as a result of a violent crime. According to CICS guidance, compensation can be awarded to victims of sexual or physical abuse.\nBut when Kelly applied to the scheme for compensation in April her application was refused.\nA letter from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) - which processes applications on behalf of the Ministry of Justice - said the offence did not occur in a \"relevant place\" as defined by the scheme. She appealed against the decision but in May was refused again.\nThe current rules of the scheme state an aircraft is only considered a \"relevant place\" if it is a British-registered aircraft within the meaning of section 92 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. Kelly was told as the offence occurred on a Qatari-registered aircraft, she was ineligible for compensation. She believes this is unfair.\n\"I understand that he's been sentenced and he's done what he's done and he's paying the price for that. But what about me? I can't afford certain therapy,\" Kelly said. \"I just want to be compensated for what I've been through. I want professional help and I want to be heard.\"\nHer lawyers at the firm Leigh Day argue the decision is \"irrational\".\nIn 1996, the Civil Aviation Act was changed so that crimes committed on foreign planes bound for the UK could be prosecuted in UK criminal courts. This change meant that Jussab could be arrested and charged when the Qatar Airways flight landed at Gatwick last autumn.\nBut victims in these cases still cannot claim compensation.\nLeigh Day wants the change to also apply to the CICS scheme so that people like Kelly can successfully apply for compensation.\nIt is calling on Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood to close what it calls a gap in the law.\n\"Under the current scheme, it appears that a violent sexual assault on a British-registered aircraft is eligible for compensation while a victim of the same violent assault on a foreign registered aircraft - on a UK-bound flight where the perpetrator is prosecuted under UK law - is excluded,\" Leigh Day's Claire Powell said.\nShe called for this to be changed urgently \"in light of this government's commitment to addressing violence against women and girls\".\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts remain with this victim, and we remain resolute in our mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade.\n\"The rules that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority follows, and the values of payments for injuries, are set by Parliament. Other routes are available for victims to receive support.\"\nAs well as her fight for compensation, Kelly says she is speaking out to persuade women to be aware of their surroundings, and of others, while travelling on public transport, especially when alone.\n\"Please be aware.

I think he wants to make a deal for me. You understand that? As crazy as that sounds,\" Trump told Macron, appearing to refer to Putin.\nIt remains to be seen how straightforward it will be to bring two such bitter enemies face-to-face at the negotiating table for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\nFor months, Zelensky has been pushing to meet Putin, although this was likely a way of proving his argument that Russia is not serious about pursuing peace, as he believed the Kremlin had no interest in such a meeting.\nMoscow has repeatedly turned down the idea of a Putin-Zelensky sit-down.\nA noncommittal statement from Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov on Monday night said it was \"worthwhile\" to \"explore the possibility of raising the level of representatives\" from the Russian and Ukrainian delegations in negotiations.\nTrump seemed to dismiss the need for any ceasefire before negotiations to end the war can take place.\nIn the past, that has been a key demand of Ukraine, which made clear it sees an end to the fighting as a prerequisite for further talks with Russia and, ultimately, for a longer-term settlement.\nA ceasefire could also be marginally easier to agree than a full peace deal, which would take many months of negotiations, during which Russia's assault on Ukraine would probably continue.\n\"I don't know that it's necessary,\" Trump said of a ceasefire.\nBut the European leaders appeared to push back, with the strongest rebuttal coming from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\n\"I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire,\" Merz said. \"So, let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia.\"\nWhen asked to speak, Zelensky did not reiterate his previous calls for a ceasefire to be put in place.\nTrump told Zelensky the US would help guarantee Ukraine's security in any deal to end the war, without specifying the extent of any assistance.\nThe US president did not offer boots on the ground. But when asked by reporters whether US security guarantees for Ukraine could include any American military in the country, Trump did not rule it out.\nHe said Europe was the \"first line of defence\", but that \"we'll be involved\".\n\"We'll give them good protection,\" the president said at one point.\nThis is the most decisive Trump has ever sounded on the issue of security guarantees, which are generally seen as paramount to any sort of deal with Russia.\nHe also said that during last week's Alaska summit Putin had accepted that there would be security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any peace deal.\nAt a news conference after Monday's meetings, Zelensky said part of the security guarantee would involve a $90bn (\u00a367bn) arms deal between the US and Ukraine.\nHe said this would include US weapons that Ukraine does not have, including aviation systems, anti-missile systems \"and other things I will not disclose\".\nZelensky also said the US would buy Ukrainian drones, which would help fund their domestic production of the unmanned craft.\nThe Ukrainian president told reporters that security guarantees for Kyiv would probably be worked out within 10 days.\nGiven his acrimonious last visit to the Oval Office in February, the Ukrainian president went to considerable lengths to charm his American hosts - including a flurry of six \"thank yous\" within the first few minutes of the meeting.\nThe last time he was at the White House, Zelensky was scolded by Vice-President JD Vance for a perceived lack of gratitude for US support for Ukraine.\nThis time, Zelenksy was wearing a dark suit rather than his traditional military garb, which drew a gibe from Trump last time that his guest was \"all dressed up today\".\nZelensky also sought to forge family ties during the meeting, handing his host a letter from Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska to be delivered to US First Lady Melania Trump.\n\"It's not to you - [it's] to your wife,\" he told Trump.\nEuropean leaders dialled up the flattery with Trump ahead of their multilateral meeting, heaping praise on him for his work in bringing them around the table.\n\"I really want to thank you for your leadership,\" said Nato chief Mark Rutte.\nItalian PM Giorgia Meloni said while there had previously been no sign that Russia wanted to move towards peace \"something had changed\"  thanks to Trump.\nDespite the warm tones, the Europeans tried to convey that they, too, feel exposed to any future Russian aggression.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told fellow leaders somberly: \"When we talk about security guarantees, we're also talking about the matter of the security of the European continent.\"", "tags": ["War in Ukraine", "Volodymyr Zelensky", "Donald Trump", "Ukraine"]}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d0v8ljw3no", "headline": "'No-one was expecting this': European leaders rush to US to help Ukraine avoid 'capitulation'", "author": "James Landale", "body": "European leaders may have rushed to Washington ostensibly to throw a protective arm around President Zelensky and head off any repeat of February's Oval Office bust-up.\nBut their real aim is to stop US President Donald Trump threatening long-term European security after his abrupt change of course over how best to end the war in Ukraine.\nNot only did Trump drop calls for a ceasefire as a prerequisite for talks about long-term peace, he also - diplomats say - made clear he had no intention of imposing further economic sanctions on Russia.\nIn short, the travelling European heads of government \u2013 plus EU and Nato leaders - want to avoid not just confrontation, but also capitulation.\nPresident Macron of France was the latest to use the C word, saying on Sunday: \"There is only one state proposing a peace that would be a capitulation: Russia.\"\nIt takes a great deal for heads of government to upend their schedules at short notice \u2013 especially in August \u2013 when some are on holiday.\nThe French leader was enjoying water sports on the Riviera. The Italian leader, Giorgia Meloni, had been in Greece.\nBut such was the scale of President Trump's change of strategy after meeting President Putin \u2013 and the consequent potential threat to Europe \u2013 that the European leaders changed their plans fast.\nOfficials say Meloni was first to invite herself along, followed closely by Macron, after which it became inevitable others would have to go too.\nThe leaders spent the weekend working the phones, holding no fewer than five separate group chats.\nTheir concern wasTrump's decision to change the diplomatic goal postsafter meeting the Russian leader in Alaska.\nSome officials think the huge impact of these two decisions \u2013 which overturned months of western strategy \u2013 has been under-priced. Both moves shifted the US position more closely in Russia's favour.\n\"Things have moved very significantly and quite quickly to a timetable that no one was expecting,\" one European official said.\n\"The US sees this as a moment to strike while the iron is hot. Our question is what are we trying to achieve here?\"\nThey added: \"The European position has long been that Putin needs to show a genuine desire to get around a table and stop the war, and that would involve a ceasefire. But since Friday we have moved on from that. The question now is how we can get out of today without a blow-up. This is a moment of extreme jeopardy.\"\nThe aim for European leaders, diplomats say, is to shift White House thinking on two issues.\nOne, the idea that peace can be achieved simply by Ukraine ceding the Donbas to Russia. And two, that this is not just about the future of Ukraine.\n\"This is fundamentally about the security of our continent,\" one British diplomat said.\nIn other words, any discussion about security guarantees \u2013 as part of a final deal \u2013 would be about ensuring the wider security of Europe and not just Ukraine.\nThat means convincing Trump of two things: one, that questions about territory and security guarantees cannot be separated, and two, that security guarantees must be about more than verbal or textual promises.\nUS negotiators have talked about giving Ukraine as yet ill-defined Nato-style assurances that the west would come to Kyiv's aid against future Russian aggression.\n\"Nobody is clear what Trump means about a security guarantee,\" one official said.\n\"He believes that him simply saying to Putin \"don't attack\" is enough. That's not good enough for Ukraine or us.\"\nThe Europeans, instead, are expected to argue that Ukraine's security will be guaranteed only by allowing its army to remain strong, with long-term and substantial allied military and financial support.\nThat would include American weapons bought by Europeans and gifted to Ukraine, plus continued Ukrainian access to US intelligence.\nBy definition, all that would exclude Russian demands for the demilitarisation of Ukraine.\nThe risk for the Europeans today is that they push Trump too hard, that he thinks he is being bullied, and that the meetings go badly.\nThe European delegation has been thrown together at the last minute.\nIt is \u2013 one official said \u2013 \"quite unwieldy\", and some differ on how much Europe should commit to Ukraine's future security.\nWhat role a future European-based \"reassurance\" force might play in a post-conflict Ukraine remains unclear.\nSo the European aim today may be to slow things down and calm fevered talk about land-swap deals that should really be part of the endgame of a negotiation.\nTo some, that would be putting the cart before the horse.\nInstead, the European leaders may look for progress on a possible trilateral summit with Trump, Zelensky and Putin; the carving out of some broad principles of any future deal; and how to have talks about talks deciding the location and framework of any negotiations.\nAnd above all, whether this can happen only when a ceasefire of sorts has been agreed.", "tags": ["War in Ukraine", "Volodymyr Zelensky", "Russia", "Ukraine"]}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3ke05355o", "headline": "Son of Norway's crown princess charged with rape and abuse", "author": "Seher Asaf", "body": "The eldest son of Norway's crown princess has been charged with 32 offences, including four counts of rape, a prosecutor says.\nThe charges against Marius Borg H\u00f8iby, 28, include the abuse of a former partner and violations of restraining orders against another former partner.\nHe was born from a relationship before Crown Princess Mette-Marit married Crown Prince Haakon, who is the future king of Norway.\nMr H\u00f8iby denies the most serious accusations against him, but plans to plead guilty to some lesser charges when the trial starts, his lawyer Petar Sekulic told Reuters news agency.\nHe could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of the most serious charges.\n\nHe has also been charged with filming the genitals of a number of women without their knowledge or consent, prosecutor Sturla Henriksb\u00f8 told reporters.\n\"He does not agree with the claims regarding rape and domestic violence,\" Mr Sekulic said of his client, according to Reuters.\nSpeaking about the charges against his stepson, Norwegian Crown Prince Haakon on Tuesday said it was up to the courts what would happen, adding that everyone involved in the case \"probably finds it challenging and difficult\", Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported.\nThe four alleged rapes are said to have occurred between 2018 and 2024, with one of them allegedly taking place after his arrest, according to NRK.\nMr H\u00f8iby, who does not have a royal title or official duties, was arrested three separate times last year, in August, September and November.

The church's move is the most spectacular and symbolic moment of the wider relocation of buildings in Kiruna, which lies 145km north of the Arctic Circle.\nThe journey began with a blessing from the church's vicar, Lena Tj\u00e4rnberg, and Bishop \u00c5sa Nystr\u00f6m of the Diocese of Lule\u00e5.\nAs the short ceremony ended, engines rumbled to life and the massive wooden church began inching forward. In the first hour, it managed just 30m, the trailers' wheels slowly turning under its weight.\nLarge crowds lined the streets under clear blue skies, watching in awe as the timber structure rolled forward. Safety barriers kept people back, but the building passed so close that many said it felt as though they could almost reach out and touch it.\n\"It's a big crowd. People came not just from Kiruna and other parts of Sweden. I heard many different languages being spoken,\" said culture strategist Sofia Lagerl\u00f6f M\u00e4tt\u00e4\u00e4. \"It's like history taking place in front of our eyes.\"\nThe man in charge of the move, project manager Stefan Holmblad Johansson, said: \"It's a historic event, a very big and complex operation and we don't have a margin of error. But everything is under control.\"\nBy the mid-2010s, other buildings in Kiruna were already being shifted to safer ground. Most were demolished and rebuilt, but some landmarks were moved intact.\nThese include buildings in Hjalmar Lundbohmsg\u00e5rden such as the so-called yellow row of three old wooden houses and the former home of mining manager Hjalmar Lundbohm, which was split into three parts.\nThe clock tower on the roof of the old city hall was also moved and can now be found next to the new city hall.\nUnder Swedish law, mining activity cannot take place under buildings.\nRobert Ylitalo, chief executive officer of Kiruna's development company, explained: \"There's no risk of people falling through cracks. But fissures would eventually damage the water, electricity and sewage supply. People have to move before the infrastructure fails.\"\nThe iron ore mine's operator, LKAB - also Kiruna's biggest employer - is covering the city's relocation bill, estimated at more than 10bn Swedish krona ($1bn; \u00a3737m).\nKiruna Church is 35m (115ft) high, 40m wide and weighs 672 tonnes.  It was once voted Sweden's most beautiful pre-1950 building.\nRelocating such a large building is an unusual feat. But instead of dismantling it, engineers are moving it in one piece, supported by steel beams and carried on self-propelled modular transporters.\n\"The biggest challenge was preparing the road for such a wide building,\" said Mr Johansson.\n\"We've widened it to 24 metres (79ft) and along the way we removed lamp-posts, traffic lights as well as a bridge that was slated for demolition anyway.\"\nAmong the onlookers were Lena Edkvist and her husband, who had driven from Gothenburg.\n\"I'm not a deeply religious person - I only go to church on special occasions.

I'm thrilled and just enjoying the moment. The weather is good, and I'm confident everything will run smoothly.\"\nAmong the most delicate aspects of the move is the protection of the church's interior treasures, especially its great altar painting made by Prince Eugen, a member of Sweden's royal family.\n\"It's not something hanging on a hook that you just take off,\" said project manager Mr Johansson.\n\"It's glued directly onto a masonry wall so it would have been difficult to remove without damage. So it will remain inside the church during the move, fully covered and stabilised. So will the organ with its 1,000 pipes.\"\nThe move is much more than an engineering marvel for local residents - it's a deeply emotional moment.\n\"The church has served as a spiritual centre and a gathering place for the community for generations,\" said Sofia Lagerl\u00f6f M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, who remembers walking into the church for the first time as a young child with her grandmother.\n\"The move has brought back memories of joy and sorrow to us, and we're now moving those memories with us into the future.\"\nThat feeling is also shared by project manager Stefan Holmblad Johansson, an engineer who doubles as a member of the church's gospel choir.\n\"This is a very special task for me,\" he said. \"The church was built over a 100 years ago for the municipality by LKAB. Now we move it to the new city. There simply can't be any other way.\"\nFor the vicar, Lena Tj\u00e4rnberg, the moment carries added meaning.\n\"The church is leaving a place where it truly belongs,\" she said.\n\"Everyone knows it has to be relocated: we live in a mining community and depend on the mine.

From what Sir Keir said overnight, it seems he believes that small sacrifice was well worth it.\nHe co-chaired a virtual meeting of European and Commonwealth allies, the coalition of the willing, on Tuesday to update leaders and to discuss next steps.\nFollowing the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had outlined plans for the coalition and US counterparts to meet in the coming days to prepare for the deployment of a \"reassurance force\" if hostilities were to end.\nThe leaders also discussed how further pressure could be placed on Putin, including through sanctions.\nSeparately, Trump told Fox News that Ukraine was \"not going to be a part of Nato\", the military treaty of western nations, but suggested that European troops would be in Ukraine to deter any future Russian attack.\n\"Some of them, France and Germany, a couple of them, the UK - they are going to have boots on the ground,\" he said.\nSir Keir has long been a proponent of so-called gratitude diplomacy - thanking and praising Trump - so he was hardly likely to be critical about the outcomes.\nAnd while anxiety in UK government circles about Ukraine's future remains, the prime minister seems happy with what he argues is significant progress.\nHe told the BBC after the White House summit that it \"has shown that we have moved forward\".\nBehind the scenes, European officials had worried the White House meeting was fraught with risk.\nOne told me they felt there was a danger of President Trump sensing President Zelensky was not committed to a US-led peace process, concluding that European leaders were digging in behind the Ukrainians, and making his frustration clear on camera.\nSuch division would have been a gift to Moscow so all the leaders involved were at pains to make clear that was not their approach.\nBefore he left Washington, Sir Keir said there was \"a real sense ofunity\"between them.\nThe prime minister told the BBC he was \"very pleased\" with the outcomes, including progress on security guarantees, saying this would \"reassure people in Europe, in Ukraine, but particularly in the United Kingdom\".\nHe also welcomed the \"real movement forward\" on bilateral and trilateral meetings between Russia, Ukraine and the US, saying this would help achieve a \"peace that is lasting and just\".\nUkraine and Europe's leaders have clearly decided together to go all in on Trump's peace plans.\nThe assessment of diplomats from various countries involved is that if the process ultimately fails, they will not have contributed to that failure.\n\nThe UK government now seems focused on ensuring Ukraine is in the strongest possible position for any possible peace negotiations.\nFrom my conversations with UK officials, they believe Monday's White House meeting was helpful in this effort on two points.\nFirstly, Trump did not echo Putin's demands for Ukrainian territory and put Zelensky on the spot on what is a sensitive and emotive issue - at least in front of the cameras.\nThere now seems to be an unspoken acceptance in the White House that Ukraine will need to move carefully and slowly on any discussions over land. No 10 has repeatedly said that questions of territory are a matter for Ukraine, and Ukraine alone.\n\"No decision should be made about Ukraine without Ukraine,\" the prime minister stressed after Monday's talks.\nSecondly, flexibility is important in any negotiation. UK officials argue that Trump's commitment to US involvement in \"cast iron\" security guarantees means Zelensky can now be far more flexible in his approach knowing that Ukraine will be protected by its allies.\nProspects of a pre-negotiation ceasefire seem to have been junked. Trump has dismissed the need for ceasefire and wants to move directly to agreeing peace terms.\nThe importance of having a ceasefire was mentioned in the White House talks by the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe UK's assessment is that a ceasefire was never a central aim of the US administration and therefore Sir Keir should not risk being what one source called a \"lone point of tension\" on the issue.\nThe prime minister has returned to the UK, but military officials - including the chief of defence staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin - are travelling in the opposite direction ahead of detailed discussions about US involvement in security guarantees.\nFrom the outset, Sir Keir has said any deal would require a strong US \"backstop\".\nTrump has yet to provide much detail on what US forces might offer, but European leaders seem content to take his public commitment as important progress.\nThe major unknown is what Moscow will do next.\nOne involved argues Putin could retreat from the pathway towards peace that has been created for him. If he does so they are hoping the US sides with Europe and not Russia.", "tags": ["War in Ukraine", "Volodymyr Zelensky", "Keir Starmer", "Donald Trump"]}]
