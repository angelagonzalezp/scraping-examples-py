        "author": "Katya Adler",
        "body": "As soon as Magnus M\u00e6land became mayor of a small town on Norway's northern tip in late 2023, three delegations from China came knocking on his door.\n\"It's because they want to be a polar superpower,\" he tells me.\nChina might not instinctively spring to mind when you think about the Arctic - but it's determined to be a big Arctic player. It's been vying to buy real estate, get involved in infrastructure projects and hopes to establish a permanent regional presence.\nChina already describes itself as a \"near-Arctic state\", even though its northernmost regional capital Harbin is on roughly the same latitude as Venice, Italy.\nBut the Arctic is fast becoming one of the most hotly-contested parts of the world. Beijing faces stiff competition from Russia, Europe, India and the US.\nThe race for the Arctic is on.\nClimate scientists say the Arctic is warming four times faster than anywhere else. This impacts ecosystems, wildlife and local populations. The Arctic is enormous, encompassing 4% of the globe.\nBut global powers see a new world of opportunities opening up in the Arctic on the back of environmental changes.\nThe melting ice in the Arctic makes it easier to access the region's incredible natural resources - critical minerals, oil, and gas - around 30% of untapped natural gas is said to be found in the Arctic.\nAnd it's opening up possibilities for new maritime trade routes, drastically reducing travel time between Asia and Europe. In the export business, time is money. China has been developing a \"Polar Silk Road\" plan for Arctic shipping.\nWhen I visit, the port of Kirkenes looks pretty ghostly.\nInside the Arctic Circle, at the northernmost point of mainland Norway, the former mining town is a gritty contrast with the picture-postcard, snow-covered mountains and fjords that surround it.\nThere are shuttered shops and abandoned warehouses, riddled with broken windows. The town feels forgotten and left behind.\nSo you can imagine the appeal of possibly becoming the first European port of call for masses of container ships from Asia, depending on how fast the polar ice continues to melt.\nThe town's port director, Terje J\u00f8rgensen, plans to build a brand new international port. His eyes light up when he talks about becoming the Singapore of Europe's High North.\n\"What we're trying to build here in Kirkenes is a trans-shipment port where three continents meet: North America, Europe and Asia. We'll take the goods ashore and reload onto other vessels [for further export]. We don't need to sell any land to anyone. Not to a UK company, not a Chinese company.\nNew laws in Norway prohibit the transfer of property or businesses, if the sale could harm \"Norwegian security interests\", he says. What they're waiting for, he adds, are clear guidelines from the government about what kind of critical infrastructure this might cover.\nMayor M\u00e6land certainly seems wary of China's intentions. \"We want a relationship with China, but we don't want to be dependent on China,\" he tells me.\n\"Europe has to ask itself 'How dependent do you want to be on totalitarian and authoritarian regimes?'\"\nChina's purchase-your-way-into-the-Arctic approach is beginning to be rejected across the European Arctic. Recent attempts by Beijing to buy into seaports in Norway and Sweden and an airport in Greenland, for example, were rebuffed.\nThis is pushing polar-hungry China - the biggest emerging superpower in the world - into the arms of the Arctic's largest player, Russia.\nRussia controls a whopping half of the Arctic shoreline - and it's been hoovering up Chinese investments.\nThe two countries cooperate militarily in the Arctic too. China's coastguard entered the Arctic for the first time in October, in a joint patrol with Russian forces. The two countries had staged joint military exercises here the month earlier. In July, long-range bombers from both countries provocatively patrolled the Arctic Ocean near Alaska in the United States.\nIt's as if Beijing and Moscow are looking over at Nato, which has stepped up its exercises in the Arctic, and are saying: We can do this too.\nEvery country bordering the Arctic is a member of Nato except Russia. Finland and Sweden joined after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAndreas \u00d8sthagen, a senior fellow at the independent Fridtjof Nansen Institute, describes the Arctic as \"low-hanging fruit\" for Russian-Chinese collaboration.\n\"Russia needs investments and commercial actors who are interested in developing the Arctic - LNG [liquefied natural gas] resources, oil resources, or developing a northern sea route as a shipping lane.\n\"China is that market. The two countries are looking for ways to expand their political, economic, even military cooperation.\"\nBut China is keen not to align itself too closely with Russia. It wants to avoid Western sanctions and to continue doing business with Western powers, inside and outside the Arctic.\nRussia has reservations too.\n\"Be careful not to overrate the Russia-China relationship,\" says Mr \u00d8sthagen. \"Russia remains wary of letting China too deep into its Arctic.\"\nMoscow relies heavily on its natural resources there. And it's courting other Arctic investors too, including the US, according to reports.\nRussia also relies on its Arctic to store strategic weapons - mainly on its Kola peninsula, which bristles with nuclear capabilities and is home to its legendary Northern Fleet.\nBack in Norway, Kirkenes residents live under that shadow of the Russian Bear next door. They always have. The border with Russia is a 10 minutes drive away by car. And Kola peninsula feels uncomfortably close.\nIn Cold War times, the town became known as a nest of spies - a frontline between the West and the Soviet Union.\nNorway believes Russia is using its Arctic to train new recruits to fight, and to fly bombers from, to attack Ukraine.\nThough not directly at war with Russia, Norway, and specifically the north of the country along its roughly 200km long land border, feels under attack.\n\"We see it here locally,\" says Col J\u00f8rn Kviller, speaking to me by the clear waters of the Pasvik River that separates Norway and Russia. Just in front of us are Norway's bright yellow, and Russia's red and green, border posts.\nSince the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there have been increasingly frequent incidents of GPS jamming that have even caused commercial pilots to change navigation systems. Cases of espionage by the border - \"everything from signals intelligence to agents being sent to Norway\" - have shot up, Col Kviller tells me.\nNorway and its Nato allies are also on the alert for Russian spy submarines and other vessels in the Arctic.\nI'm able to see how Norway monitors this threat, after we get high security clearance to enter the country's Cold War-era joint military command. It's deep inside a quartz mountain in Bod\u00f8, within the Arctic Circle.\nWe find a labyrinth of tunnels and surveillance rooms where Norway gathers real-time intelligence from land, air and sea, focused on suspicious-looking vessels in and near its Arctic waters. Everything is shared in real-time with Nato allies.\nCrucially, any Russian vessel wanting to enter Europe has to pass through Norwegian waters first.\nAgents in the mountain HQ are on the lookout for signs of espionage and sabotage around what officials call underwater \"critical infrastructure\" as part of the Kremlin's hybrid warfare against the West.\nTargets include undersea communications cables - connecting continents and permitting trillions of dollars' worth of financial transactions a day - and also oil and gas pipelines.\nNorway is a major supplier of natural gas to Europe, including the UK, especially since sanctions were imposed on Russian exports following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nMoscow has been modernising its military capabilities in the Arctic. It has a serious fleet of spy and nuclear submarines. If they pass undetected, they could potentially target missiles at capitals across Europe and also threaten the US.\nUS President Donald Trump has told Europe it must do more for its own defence, but inside the Arctic, there is a \"great overlap of interests\", says the chief of the Norwegian joint headquarters Vice Adm Rune Andersen.\n\"This is also about US homeland defence\u2026 The Russian concentration of nuclear weapons, the capabilities that Russia is deploying are not only aimed at Europe, but also at the US,\" he says.\nVice Adm Andersen doesn't believe any party is courting open conflict in the Arctic but with global tensions rising elsewhere, such as over Ukraine, the potential for spillover in the Arctic is there.\nThe vice admiral's team schedules a routine call to Russia's Northern Fleet every Wednesday afternoon -to keep communication channels open, they say. Just in case.\nIf you leave Kirkenes and head towards the North Pole, you come across the magnificent Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard at about the half-way mark. It's home to ice floes, glaciers and more polar bears than people.\nSvalbard is at the heart of the scramble between global powers for Arctic resources. While Norwegian, the archipelago is governed by a treaty allowing people from all countries that signed it to work there visa-free. Most are employed in mines, tourism and scientific research.\nThat may sound harmonious, but since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there's been a noticeable flexing of nationalist muscles in some communities here.\nThey include military parades by the Russian settlement to mark their commemorations for the end of World War Two, the flying of a Soviet flag over Russian infrastructure, and growing suspicion that the Chinese have made their Svalbard research station dual-purpose - for military espionage.\nRegardless of whether or not that's true, local mayor Terje Aunevik says it would be na\u00efve to suggest there was no intelligence-gathering going on in the different countries' research centres.\n\"Of course there is... I think the world has been gripped by Arctic fomo [fear of missing out].\"\nThe day I arrive in Svalbard, it's Norway's national day. The streets are thronging with a snaking parade of mums, dads and children from the local school, clad in Norwegian national dress.\nLongyearbyen is the northernmost town in the world. Bright sunshine glints off the Arctic waters below the main street, and the flat-topped, snow and ice-covered mountains all around.\nEverywhere I look, I see shop windows, prams and women's hairdos festooned with blue, white and red Norwegian flags. Perhaps I imagined it, but among all the cheeriness, it felt like there was another, unspoken sentiment that day, a reminder: 'Svalbard belongs to us!'\nThe rising mood of national rivalries in the Arctic is not without consequences.\nIndigenous communities in the region, just over half of whom live in the Russian Arctic, often feel that there is a failure on the part of those in power to acknowledge the rights of the peoples who have long called the region home.\nMiyuki Daorana, a youth activist from Greenland representing the Inughuit indigenous community, says when Donald Trump claimed he wanted to buy the country during his first presidency, they laughed it off. But this time it feels different, she says.\n\"Because of the current global political situation, with power play and competition for resources, it's much more serious.\"\nShe, and others in the indigenous communities, accuse European countries of using the \"climate crisis\" as an excuse to \"extract and invade indigenous lands\".\n\"It's something we call green colonialism or developmental aggression where they really want to just take more and more from lands,\" she says.\n\"[The Arctic] is not just a topic for us. It's not just an interest, it's not a study. It's literally our lives and real struggles and emotions and very unfair injustices.\n\"The government and the politicians, they're supposed to work for the people. But I haven't seen that. It's mostly diplomatic words.\"\nNot long ago, you used to hear talk of Arctic exceptionalism, where the eight countries bordering the Arctic - Canada, Russia, the US, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland - along with representatives of six Arctic indigenous communities and other observer countries, including China and the UK, would put aside political differences to work together to protect and govern this incredible part of the world.\nBut these are times now of big power politics. Countries increasingly act in their own interests.\nWith so many rival nations now in the Arctic, the risks of misinterpretation or miscalculation are high.",

        "author": "Mallory Moench",
        "body": "An Israeli air strike on Gaza hit the home of a doctor and killed nine of her 10 children, the hospital where she works in the city of Khan Younis says.\nNasser hospital said one of Dr Alaa al-Najjar's children and her husband were injured, but survived. Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital, said he had operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy.\nA video shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry and verified by the BBC showed small burned bodies being lifted from the rubble of a strike in Khan Younis on Friday.\nThe BBC has approached Israel's military for comment.\nMore than 70 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Friday, with at least another six killed so far on Saturday, the Hamas-run civil defence agency told AFP.\nDr Muneer Alboursh, director of the health ministry, said on X that the family house was hit minutes after Dr al-Najjar's husband Hamdi had returned home after driving his wife to work.\nDr Alboursh said the eldest of Dr al-Najjar's children was aged 12.\nMr Groom said that the children's father was \"very badly injured\", in a videoposted on the Instagram accountof another British surgeon working at Nasser hospital, Victoria Rose.\nHe said he had asked about the father, also a doctor at the hospital, and had been told he had \"no political and no military connections and doesn't seem to be prominent on social media\".\nHe described it as an \"unimaginable\" situation for Dr al-Najjar.\nMahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, said on Telegram on Friday afternoon that his teams had recovered eight bodies and several injured from the al-Najjar house near a petrol station in Khan Younis.\nThe hospital initially posted on Facebook that eight children had been killed, then two hours later updated that number to nine.\nIn an interview recorded by AFP news agency, relative Youssef al-Najjar said: \"Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us.\n\"We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!\"\nOn Friday, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that people in Gaza were enduring what may be \"the cruellest phase\" of the war, and denounced Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid imposed in March.\nIsrael partially lifted the blockade earlier this week. Israeli military body Cogat said 83 more trucks carrying flour, food, medical equipment pharmaceutical drugs entered Gaza on Friday.\nThe UN has repeatedly said the amount of aid entering is nowhere near enough for the territory's 2.1 million people - saying between 500 to 600 trucks a day are needed - and has called for Israel to allow in much more.\nThe limited amount of food that trickled into Gaza this week sparked chaotic scenes, with armed looters attacking an aid convoy and Palestinians crowding outside bakeries in a desperate attempt to obtain bread.\nA UN-backed assessment this month said Gaza's population was at \"critical risk\" of famine.\nPeople in Gaza have told the BBC they have no food, and malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed babies.\nChronic shortages of water are also worsening as desalination and hygiene plants are running out of fuel, and Israel's expanding military offensive causes new waves of displacement.\nIsrael has said the blockade was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages still held in Gaza.\nIsrael has accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 53,822 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.\nAdditional reporting by David Gritten and Yaroslav Lukov",

        "headline": "Her daughter was taken and sent abroad - 44 years later, they found each other",
        "author": "Juna Moon and Tessa Wong",
        "body": "The last memory Han Tae-soon has of her daughter as a child is in May 1975, at their home in Seoul.\n\"I was going to the market and asked Kyung-ha, 'Aren't you coming?' But she told me, 'No, I'm going to play with my friends',\" recalled Ms Han.\n\"When I came back, she was gone.\"\nMs Han would not see her daughter again for more than four decades. When they reunited, Kyung-ha was almost unrecognisable as a middle-aged American woman named Laurie Bender.\nKyung-ha had been kidnapped near her home, brought to an orphanage, then sent illegally to the US to be raised by another family, alleges Ms Han, who is now suing the South Korean government for failing to prevent her daughter's adoption.\nShe is among the hundreds of people who have come forward in recent years with damning allegations of fraud, illegal adoptions, kidnapping and human trafficking in South Korea's controversial overseas adoption programme.\nNo other country has sent as many children abroad for adoption, and for so long, as South Korea. Since the programme began in the 1950s, about 170,000 to 200,000 children have been adopted overseas - most of them in the West.\nIn March,a landmark inquiryfound that successive governments had committed human rights violations with their lack of oversight, allowing private agencies to \"mass export\" children for profit on an industrial scale.\nExperts say the findings could open the door to more lawsuits against the government. Ms Han's is set to go to court next month.\nIt is one of two landmark cases. Ms Han is the first biological parent of an overseas adoptee seeking damages from the government, while in 2019, a man who was adopted in the US wasthe first adoptee to sue.\nA government spokesman told the BBC that it \"deeply sympathises with the emotional pain of individuals and families who could not find each other for a long time\".\nIt added that it considered Ms Han's case with \"deep regret\" and that it would take \"necessary actions\" based on the outcome of the trial.\nMs Han, 71, told the BBC she is determined the government takes responsibility.\n\"I spent 44 years ruining my body and mind searching for [my daughter]. But in all that time, has anyone ever apologised to me? No one. Not once.\"\nFor decades, she and her husband visited police stations and orphanages, put up flyers, and went on television appealing for information. Ms Han said she spent all day pounding the streets looking for her daughter \"till all 10 of my toenails fell out\".\nOver the years she thought she came close. In 1990, after one of her TV appeals, Ms Han met a woman who she believed could be Kyung-ha, and even took her in to live with her family for a while. But the woman eventually confessed she was not her daughter.\nA breakthrough finally happened in 2019 when Ms Han signed up with325 Kamra, a group that connects overseas Korean adoptees with their birth parents by matching their DNA.\nThey soon reported a match - Laurie Bender, a nurse in California. After several phone calls, she flew over to Seoul to meet Ms Han, where the two had a tearful reunion at the airport.\nAs they embraced, Ms Han ran her fingers through Kyung-ha's hair. \"I've been a hairdresser for 30 years. I can quickly tell if it's my daughter just by feeling her hair. I had mistakenly thought I found her before, so I had to touch and feel the hair to confirm it,\" she said.\nThe first thing she told her daughter was \"I'm so sorry\".\n\"I felt guilty because she couldn't find her way home when she was a child. I kept thinking about how much she must have searched for her mother\u2026 Meeting her after all those years made me realise how much she must have longed for her mother, and it broke my heart.\"\n\"It's like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,\" Kyung-ha said about their reunion in an earlier interview with the Associated Press.  She did not respond to the BBC's requests for an interview.\nThe pair eventually pieced together what happened on that day in May 1975.\nKyung-ha, who was six years old at the time, was playing near her home when she was approached by a strange woman claiming to know her mother. Kyung-ha was told her mother \"didn't need\" her any more and was taken to a train station.\nAfter taking a train ride with the woman, Kyung-ha was abandoned at the final stop, where she was eventually picked up by police officers and placed in an orphanage. Soon, she was flown to the US to be adopted by a couple in Virginia.\nYears later, checks revealed she was given false papers stating she was an abandoned orphan whose parents were unknown.\n\"It's like you've been living a fake life and everything you know is not true,\" Kyung-ha said previously.\nHer case was far from an isolated one.\nSouth Korea's overseas adoption programme began in the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War, when it was a deeply impoverished country with an estimated 100,000 orphaned and displaced children.\nAt that time, few families were willing to adopt non-biological children, and the government began an overseas adoption programme, billed as a humanitarian effort.\nThe programme was handled entirely by private adoption agencies. While they were under government oversight, over time these agencies gained significant autonomy through laws.\nAs their power grew, so did the number of children being sent abroad, rising in the 1970s and peaking in the 1980s. In 1985 alone, more than 8,800 children were sent overseas.\nThere was a massive demand from the West - with declining birth rates and fewer babies to adopt at home, families began seeking children elsewhere.\nPhotos from that era show planes heading to Western countries filled with Korean children, with swaddled babies strapped to seats \u2013 what the truth and reconciliation commission's inquiry called the \"mass transportation of children like cargo\".\nThe report alleges little care was taken of these children during these long flights. In one case it cited from 1974, a lactose-intolerant child was fed milk in transit and subsequently died upon arrival in Denmark.\nCritics of the programme have long questioned why so many children needed to be sent overseas at a time when South Korea was already experiencing rapid economic growth.\nA 1976 BBC Panorama documentary, which featured South Korea as one of several Asian countries sending children to the West, quoted an observer describing the situation as \"out of control\" and \"almost like a trade in children\u2026 flowing from Asia into Europe and North America\".\nAccording to the truth and reconciliation report, foreign adoption agencies set quotas for children, which Korean agencies willingly fulfilled.\nIt was a profitable business - the lack of government regulation allowed the Korean agencies to charge large amounts and demand hidden fees termed as \"donations\".\nSome of these children may have been obtained by unscrupulous means, with parents like Ms Han alleging their children were kidnapped. In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of homeless or unattended children were rounded up and put in orphanages or welfare centres as part of a national campaign to \"clean up the streets\" of South Korea.\nOther parents were told their babies had fallen sick and died, when they were actually alive and taken to adoption agencies. Agencies also did not obtain proper consent from birth mothers to take their children for adoption, according to the truth and reconciliation report.\nThe report also stated that adoption agencies deliberately falsified information in adoption records to cut corners and quickly meet the demand for children.\nLost children who were found without any identity documents would be made to appear, in paperwork, as if they had been abandoned and put up for adoption.\nIf a child intended for adoption had died or was reclaimed by their birth parents, another child would be swapped in and assigned the original child's identity. This allowed agencies to avoid refunding adoption fees and expedite the adoption process.\nDecades on, this has created immense difficulties for many overseas adoptees trying to track down their biological parents.\nSome have wrong or missing information in their adoption records, while others have discovered they were given entirely false identities.\n\"We are victims of state violence but there is no trace of this - literally. This lack of documents must not make us victims for the second time,\" said Han Boon-young, co-founder of an overseas adoptee rights group campaigning for greater access to birth information.\n\"This is a human rights issue. There were kidnappings, falsified documents - all of which were examples of violations committed during the inter-country adoption process.\n\"It is really necessary to move towards reconciliation, that we recognise these experiences, and that the people who committed these violations be held responsible.\"\nBut some of the key players continue to stay silent or deny wrongdoing.\nThe BBC contacted Bu Chung-ha, who in the 1970s served as chairman of Holt International, South Korea's largest adoption agency.\nHolt is at the centre of numerous allegations of fraud and illegal adoptions, and the subject of two lawsuits so far, including Ms Han's.\nIn a brief reply, Mr Bu denied that the agency had sent abroad any children wrongly identified as orphans during his tenure. Any parents alleging their children were kidnapped \"did not lose their children, they abandoned them\", he said.\nThe current management of Holt International has yet to respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nExperts say the responsibility lay not only with the private agencies but also with the state.\n\"Adoption agencies exploited the system, and the government turned a blind eye - allowing illegal practices to take root,\" said Dr Lee Kyung-eun, an international law scholar at Seoul National University.\n\"The government was the captain, and the agencies rowed the boat,\" said Shin Pil-sik, a researcher on transnational adoption at Seokyeong University, who added that this structure enabled both sides to deflect accountability.\nDr Shin said the state was not a passive observer- it actively shaped adoption policy, setting annual quotas for overseas placements and even on occasion halted some  adoptions.\nAn Associated Press news investigation last yearfound successive Korean governments had rewritten laws to remove minimal safeguards and judicial oversight, fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable, and allowed foreign families to adopt Korean children quickly without ever visiting the country.\nWhile the government billed the programme as a humanitarian effort, observers say it also served to strengthen ties with Western countries.\nA 1984 government document obtained by the BBC stated that the official goals of the adoption policy included not only the welfare of children but also \"the promotion of future national strength and people-to-people diplomacy\".\nWhen asked about the state's role in past adoption practices, South Korea's health and welfare ministry said they were \"continuing efforts to strengthen state responsibility\" in the system and that it plans to promote adoptions that comply with international standards.\nIn 2012, the government revised adoption laws to tighten screening of potential adoptive parents, and to track birthparent data and birth information better.\nIt has alsoenacted reforms to the adoption systemensuring that overseas adoptions are minimised and that all adoptions would be handled by the government instead of private agencies. The changes will take effect in July.\nMeanwhile, overseas adoptions have declined. In the late 1980s, overseas adoptions dropped sharply, before stabilising in the 1990s and dropping again in the 2010s. Only 79 children were adopted abroad in 2023, according to the latest available data.\nBut as South Korea begins to address this dark chapter in its past, adoptees and birth parents like Ms Han continue to struggle with their trauma.\nAfter their initial reunion, Ms Han and Kyung-ha have struggled to maintain a close connection.\nNot only do they live on opposite sides of the world, her daughter has forgotten most of her Korean while Ms Han knows little English.\nThey keep in touch over texts occasionally, and Ms Han spends two hours every day practising her English by writing phrases in an exercise book.\nBut it isn't enough for Ms Han.\n\"Even though I have found my daughter, it doesn't feel like I've truly found her. All I know is where she is, but what good is that, if we can't even communicate?\n\"My entire life has been ruined\u2026 no amount of money will ever make up for what I've lost.\"",

It is often crowded during Friday rush hour.\nThis is the latest in a series of violent attacks in Germany in recent months.\nIn January, a two-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man werekilled in a stabbing in a park in Aschaffenburg, with several others hurt.\nA Spanish tourist wasstabbed just a month later at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial.\nLast December, six people were killed and hundreds were injured aftera car drove into a crowd at a Christmas marketin the eastern city of Magdeburg.\nThe suspects in these previous attacks were migrants, which has ledGermany to tighten border control checksand saw immigration become a key issue for voters during the country's federal elections in February.",

Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital, said he had operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy.\nA video shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry and verified by the BBC showed small burned bodies being lifted from the rubble of a strike in Khan Younis on Friday.\nThe BBC has approached Israel's military for comment.\nMore than 70 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Friday, with at least another six killed so far on Saturday, the Hamas-run civil defence agency told AFP.\nDr Muneer Alboursh, director of the health ministry, said on X that the family house was hit minutes after Dr al-Najjar's husband Hamdi had returned home after driving his wife to work.\nDr Alboursh said the eldest of Dr al-Najjar's children was aged 12.\nMr Groom said that the children's father was \"very badly injured\", in a videoposted on the Instagram accountof another British surgeon working at Nasser hospital, Victoria Rose.\nHe said he had asked about the father, also a doctor at the hospital, and had been told he had \"no political and no military connections and doesn't seem to be prominent on social media\".\nHe described it as an \"unimaginable\" situation for Dr al-Najjar.\nMahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, said on Telegram on Friday afternoon that his teams had recovered eight bodies and several injured from the al-Najjar house near a petrol station in Khan Younis.\nThe hospital initially posted on Facebook that eight children had been killed, then two hours later updated that number to nine.\nIn an interview recorded by AFP news agency, relative Youssef al-Najjar said: \"Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us.\n\"We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!\"\nOn Friday, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that people in Gaza were enduring what may be \"the cruellest phase\" of the war, and denounced Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid imposed in March.\nIsrael partially lifted the blockade earlier this week. Israeli military body Cogat said 83 more trucks carrying flour, food, medical equipment pharmaceutical drugs entered Gaza on Friday.\nThe UN has repeatedly said the amount of aid entering is nowhere near enough for the territory's 2.1 million people - saying between 500 to 600 trucks a day are needed - and has called for Israel to allow in much more.\nThe limited amount of food that trickled into Gaza this week sparked chaotic scenes, with armed looters attacking an aid convoy and Palestinians crowding outside bakeries in a desperate attempt to obtain bread.\nA UN-backed assessment this month said Gaza's population was at \"critical risk\" of famine.\nPeople in Gaza have told the BBC they have no food, and malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed babies.\nChronic shortages of water are also worsening as desalination and hygiene plants are running out of fuel, and Israel's expanding military offensive causes new waves of displacement.\nIsrael has said the blockade was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages still held in Gaza.\nIsrael has accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 53,822 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.\nAdditional reporting by David Gritten and Yaroslav Lukov",

        "author": "Steve Rosenberg",
        "body": "It's 2:30am.\nInside the Kremlin walls I'm wandering alone through the vast grounds trying - and failing - to find my way out.\nI spot a checkpoint, approach and show my passport.\n\"Nyet vykhoda!\" [\"No exit!\"] replies the guard. He points in the opposite direction.\nI walk back and, eventually, come to another checkpoint.\n\"No way out!\" says the sentry.\nI'm lost. Inside the Kremlin. In the dead of night.\nIt's like being in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel.\nIt's been quite an evening. I arrived at 5pm. Along with a small group of journalists, I'd been invited to \"an event with President Putin\". What kind of event? To begin with the Kremlin wouldn't say. Eventually we were told Vladimir Putin would be taking questions.\nEight hours later, the president strode into the Malachite Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace and sat at a desk.\nBut there'd been a change of plan. No press conference. No questions. Instead, live on Russian TV, Putin delivered a statement in which he proposed direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.\nEvent over, I walk out of the Kremlin Palace but take a wrong turn. Finally, I locate the correct exit and, bleary-eyed, take a taxi home.\nThis was the start of what has turned out to be a real rollercoaster of a fortnight. What began with a late-night Kremlin statement continued with peace talks in Turkey and then a two-hour telephone call between Putin and Donald Trump.\nBut, at the end of it, are we any closer to peace in Ukraine?\nIt doesn't feel like it.\nAlthough there is talk about more talks, and of \u0430 possible future \"memorandum\" on a \"possible future peace\", it all sounds rather vague.\nFor now, the fighting goes on.\nRussia is still refusing to sign up to an unconditional comprehensive ceasefire. It has no intention of returning any of the Ukrainian land it has seized, occupied and claims to have annexed. On the contrary: it's pushing for more.\nRight now, the Ukraine peace process resembles being lost in the Kremlin late at night.\nIt's hard to see the exit.\nAnd yet the past two weeks have revealed a lot.\nFirst, how Russia neutralises potential threats and pressure points.\nKremlin critics would put this another way: how Russia plays for time.\nOn 10 May (a few hours before I got lost in the Kremlin), after a phone call with Donald Trump, European leaders had issued an ultimatum to President Putin: agree to an unconditional long-term ceasefire in Ukraine in two days or face crushing new sanctions.\nSince March the Trump administration has been calling on Russia and Ukraine to accept a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire. Kyiv agreed. Moscow hasn't.\nThe Kremlin leader sidestepped the European ultimatum with his counter proposal of direct talks in Turkey. The idea was greeted with scepticism in Ukraine and across Europe. But it was enough to placate Trump and convince him Russia was serious about wanting peace. He was all for the talks. \"Crushing\" new sanctions were delayed.\nAhead of the Istanbul meeting on 16 May, President Trump gave the impression that Vladimir Putin might attend. The Kremlin leader did not, sending instead a comparatively low-level delegation that once more rejected the idea of a long-term ceasefire. But, again, the modest results of the talks were sufficient to persuade the US president that progress was being made.\nThen came the Trump-Putin phone call on 19 May.\nBy the end of it, Russia had still not agreed to an immediate comprehensive cessation of hostilities. Instead, according to President Trump, \"Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War\".\nBut Moscow is already casting doubt on whether it would sign any future peace treaty with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For a year now the Russian authorities have been attempting to delegitimise Ukraine's president since the expiry of his presidential term. However, Ukraine's Constitution prohibits the holding of elections in wartime.\nAnd the reason for martial law in Ukraine is Russia's invasion.\n\"Would Russia sit down and sign a peace agreement with President Zelensky?\" I asked Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday.\n\"You're putting the cart before the horse,\" Mr Lavrov replied. \"First we need to have a deal. When it's agreed, then we will decide. But, as President Putin has said many times, President Zelensky does not have legitimacy\u2026 Probably the best option would be new elections\u2026\"\nThe Russian media has concluded that, after two weeks of diplomacy, Moscow has strengthened its hand.\n\"Russia has won the latest round of global poker,\" declared the Izvestia newspaper last week.\n\"Donald Trump's stance couldn't be more advantageous to Moscow,\" wrote Kommersant. \"In effect he backed Russia's position of 'Talks first, ceasefire later' and refused to strengthen sanctions against Russia.\"\nA social scientist told Kommersant: \"Donald Trump, at least for now, is our ideological partner on certain issues. His views are much closer to Russia's than to Europe's.\"\nAnd the ultra pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda had this message for European leaders:\n\"You were warned. Don't wave threats and ultimatums in the face of the bear. Don't try to impose conditions in talks that have nothing to do with you.\n\"Just sit in the lobby and breathe in the smell of the new world order.\"\nMoscow's confidence is also fuelled by the belief that, in Ukraine, it holds the initiative on the battlefield.\nBack in 2023 Donald Trump had promised that, if he won the presidency, \"we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled\u2026 I'll get them both. I know Zelensky, I know Putin. It'll be done within 24 hours, you watch\".\nTrump has been in the Oval Office for more than four months now, but the \"horrible war\" goes on.\nOn rare occasions, he has publicly rebuked the Kremlin and threatened further sanctions. Last month he said: \"\u2026there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?'\"\nBut there's been no follow-through. The US president appears reluctant to ratchet up the pressure on the Kremlin, instead signalling to Moscow that he's keen to reboot US-Russia relations.\nFollowing the presidents' telephone conversation, Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, who'd sat in on the call, told journalists: \"Trump spoke rather emotionally about the prospects for [bilateral] relations. Trump sees Russia as one of America's most important partners in trade and economic matters.\"\nPresident Trump seems determined to push on with his rapprochement with Russia, whatever happens on Ukraine.\nAnd Moscow senses that.\n\"President Trump does not link continued US-Russia dialogue to the Ukraine peace process,\" was a headline in the Russian government paper Rossiyskaya Gazeta this week.\nThat doesn't mean the Kremlin has headed off the danger of additional restrictions completely. The US Senate has threatened tough new sanctions against Russia if Moscow doesn't get serious about diplomacy.\nUp to this point the Kremlin has been able to deflect or to sidestep whatever pressure it's come under to make compromises and concessions regarding its war on Ukraine.\nIt seems confident it will continue to do so.",

        "author": "Jaroslav Lukiv",
        "body": "The European Union's trade chief said the 27-member bloc is committed to securing a trade deal with the US based on \"respect\" not \"threats\".\nIt comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the US from the EU.\n\"The EU's fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,\" EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said after a call with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\"EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.\"\nEarlier on Friday, Trump expressed impatience with the pace of ongoing EU-US trade negotiations, saying his plan to raise tariffs on 1 June was set.\nWriting on social media, Trump said: \"Our discussions with [the EU] are going nowhere,\" adding that there would be no tariffs for products built or manufactured in the US.\n\"I'm not looking for a deal - we've set the deal,\" he told reporters later, before immediately adding that a big investment in the US by a European company might make him open to a delay.\nThe EU is one of the Washington's largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (\u20ac528bn; \u00a3443bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show.\nReacting to Trump's threats, European governments warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides.\n\"We do not need to go down this road,\" said Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin. \"Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward.\"\nFrance's Foreign Minister Laurent Saint-Martin, said: \"We are maintaining the same line: de-escalation, but we are ready to respond.\"\nGerman Economy Minister Katherina Reiche said the bloc \"must do everything\" to reach a solution with the US.\nWhile Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told reporters that he backed the EU's strategy in trade talks and \"we have seen before that tariffs can go up and down in talks with the US\".\nThe EU is negotiating with the US as a bloc, though Stephen Moore, a former economic advisor to Trumpwho works for conservativethink tank the Heritage Foundation, told the BBC: \"What may happen in Europe... is that we may try to negotiate individually with countries in Europe.\"\nHe added that in his opinion Trump's \"ultimate aim is really to decouple not just the US but the whole world from Chinese influence which would be a very good thing if he could pull that off\".\nIn early April, Trump announced tariffs against a long list of countries, including a 20% tax on most EU goods being sold into the US.\nSoon afterwards, the president paused the higher tariffs for three months, until 8 July, to allow for more negotiations, but kept a 10% baseline tax in place against the US's trade partners.\nHigher US tariffs also remained in place against China though they were substantially lowered.\nDespite the climbdown from Trump, the US kept a 25% tariff against EU steel and aluminium imports in place.\nThe EU has threatened \u2013 and paused \u2013 its own measures against the US. It said it would introduce a 25% tariff on \u20ac18bn ($20bn; \u00a315bn) worth of US goods coming into Europe but this has been put on hold.\nIt is also currently consulting on additional measures against US imports into the US valued at \u20ac95bn.\nTrump's complaints about Europe have focused on what he claims is an uneven trade relationship - the EU sells more goods to the US than it buys from America.\nTrump blames a trade deficit on policies that he claims are unfair to American companies, and he has specifically raised concerns about policies related to cars and agricultural products.\nTrump also warned Apple that he would impose a 25% import tax \"at least\" on iPhones not manufactured in America, later widening the threat to any smartphone.\nShares in the US and EU fell on Friday after the latest threats, with America's S&P 500 down about 0.7% and Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 ending the day down more than 1.5%.",

        "author": "Juna Moon and Tessa Wong",
        "body": "The last memory Han Tae-soon has of her daughter as a child is in May 1975, at their home in Seoul.\n\"I was going to the market and asked Kyung-ha, 'Aren't you coming?' But she told me, 'No, I'm going to play with my friends',\" recalled Ms Han.\n\"When I came back, she was gone.\"\nMs Han would not see her daughter again for more than four decades. When they reunited, Kyung-ha was almost unrecognisable as a middle-aged American woman named Laurie Bender.\nKyung-ha had been kidnapped near her home, brought to an orphanage, then sent illegally to the US to be raised by another family, alleges Ms Han, who is now suing the South Korean government for failing to prevent her daughter's adoption.\nShe is among the hundreds of people who have come forward in recent years with damning allegations of fraud, illegal adoptions, kidnapping and human trafficking in South Korea's controversial overseas adoption programme.\nNo other country has sent as many children abroad for adoption, and for so long, as South Korea. Since the programme began in the 1950s, about 170,000 to 200,000 children have been adopted overseas - most of them in the West.\nIn March,a landmark inquiryfound that successive governments had committed human rights violations with their lack of oversight, allowing private agencies to \"mass export\" children for profit on an industrial scale.\nExperts say the findings could open the door to more lawsuits against the government. Ms Han's is set to go to court next month.\nIt is one of two landmark cases. Ms Han is the first biological parent of an overseas adoptee seeking damages from the government, while in 2019, a man who was adopted in the US wasthe first adoptee to sue.\nA government spokesman told the BBC that it \"deeply sympathises with the emotional pain of individuals and families who could not find each other for a long time\".\nIt added that it considered Ms Han's case with \"deep regret\" and that it would take \"necessary actions\" based on the outcome of the trial.\nMs Han, 71, told the BBC she is determined the government takes responsibility.\n\"I spent 44 years ruining my body and mind searching for [my daughter]. But in all that time, has anyone ever apologised to me? No one. Not once.\"\nFor decades, she and her husband visited police stations and orphanages, put up flyers, and went on television appealing for information. Ms Han said she spent all day pounding the streets looking for her daughter \"till all 10 of my toenails fell out\".\nOver the years she thought she came close. In 1990, after one of her TV appeals, Ms Han met a woman who she believed could be Kyung-ha, and even took her in to live with her family for a while. But the woman eventually confessed she was not her daughter.\nA breakthrough finally happened in 2019 when Ms Han signed up with325 Kamra, a group that connects overseas Korean adoptees with their birth parents by matching their DNA.\nThey soon reported a match - Laurie Bender, a nurse in California. After several phone calls, she flew over to Seoul to meet Ms Han, where the two had a tearful reunion at the airport.\nAs they embraced, Ms Han ran her fingers through Kyung-ha's hair. \"I've been a hairdresser for 30 years. I can quickly tell if it's my daughter just by feeling her hair. I had mistakenly thought I found her before, so I had to touch and feel the hair to confirm it,\" she said.\nThe first thing she told her daughter was \"I'm so sorry\".\n\"I felt guilty because she couldn't find her way home when she was a child. I kept thinking about how much she must have searched for her mother\u2026 Meeting her after all those years made me realise how much she must have longed for her mother, and it broke my heart.\"\n\"It's like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,\" Kyung-ha said about their reunion in an earlier interview with the Associated Press.  She did not respond to the BBC's requests for an interview.\nThe pair eventually pieced together what happened on that day in May 1975.\nKyung-ha, who was six years old at the time, was playing near her home when she was approached by a strange woman claiming to know her mother. Kyung-ha was told her mother \"didn't need\" her any more and was taken to a train station.\nAfter taking a train ride with the woman, Kyung-ha was abandoned at the final stop, where she was eventually picked up by police officers and placed in an orphanage. Soon, she was flown to the US to be adopted by a couple in Virginia.\nYears later, checks revealed she was given false papers stating she was an abandoned orphan whose parents were unknown.\n\"It's like you've been living a fake life and everything you know is not true,\" Kyung-ha said previously.\nHer case was far from an isolated one.\nSouth Korea's overseas adoption programme began in the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War, when it was a deeply impoverished country with an estimated 100,000 orphaned and displaced children.\nAt that time, few families were willing to adopt non-biological children, and the government began an overseas adoption programme, billed as a humanitarian effort.\nThe programme was handled entirely by private adoption agencies. While they were under government oversight, over time these agencies gained significant autonomy through laws.\nAs their power grew, so did the number of children being sent abroad, rising in the 1970s and peaking in the 1980s. In 1985 alone, more than 8,800 children were sent overseas.\nThere was a massive demand from the West - with declining birth rates and fewer babies to adopt at home, families began seeking children elsewhere.\nPhotos from that era show planes heading to Western countries filled with Korean children, with swaddled babies strapped to seats \u2013 what the truth and reconciliation commission's inquiry called the \"mass transportation of children like cargo\".\nThe report alleges little care was taken of these children during these long flights. In one case it cited from 1974, a lactose-intolerant child was fed milk in transit and subsequently died upon arrival in Denmark.\nCritics of the programme have long questioned why so many children needed to be sent overseas at a time when South Korea was already experiencing rapid economic growth.\nA 1976 BBC Panorama documentary, which featured South Korea as one of several Asian countries sending children to the West, quoted an observer describing the situation as \"out of control\" and \"almost like a trade in children\u2026 flowing from Asia into Europe and North America\".\nAccording to the truth and reconciliation report, foreign adoption agencies set quotas for children, which Korean agencies willingly fulfilled.\nIt was a profitable business - the lack of government regulation allowed the Korean agencies to charge large amounts and demand hidden fees termed as \"donations\".\nSome of these children may have been obtained by unscrupulous means, with parents like Ms Han alleging their children were kidnapped. In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of homeless or unattended children were rounded up and put in orphanages or welfare centres as part of a national campaign to \"clean up the streets\" of South Korea.\nOther parents were told their babies had fallen sick and died, when they were actually alive and taken to adoption agencies. Agencies also did not obtain proper consent from birth mothers to take their children for adoption, according to the truth and reconciliation report.\nThe report also stated that adoption agencies deliberately falsified information in adoption records to cut corners and quickly meet the demand for children.\nLost children who were found without any identity documents would be made to appear, in paperwork, as if they had been abandoned and put up for adoption.\nIf a child intended for adoption had died or was reclaimed by their birth parents, another child would be swapped in and assigned the original child's identity. This allowed agencies to avoid refunding adoption fees and expedite the adoption process.\nDecades on, this has created immense difficulties for many overseas adoptees trying to track down their biological parents.\nSome have wrong or missing information in their adoption records, while others have discovered they were given entirely false identities.\n\"We are victims of state violence but there is no trace of this - literally. This lack of documents must not make us victims for the second time,\" said Han Boon-young, co-founder of an overseas adoptee rights group campaigning for greater access to birth information.\n\"This is a human rights issue. There were kidnappings, falsified documents - all of which were examples of violations committed during the inter-country adoption process.\n\"It is really necessary to move towards reconciliation, that we recognise these experiences, and that the people who committed these violations be held responsible.\"\nBut some of the key players continue to stay silent or deny wrongdoing.\nThe BBC contacted Bu Chung-ha, who in the 1970s served as chairman of Holt International, South Korea's largest adoption agency.\nHolt is at the centre of numerous allegations of fraud and illegal adoptions, and the subject of two lawsuits so far, including Ms Han's.\nIn a brief reply, Mr Bu denied that the agency had sent abroad any children wrongly identified as orphans during his tenure. Any parents alleging their children were kidnapped \"did not lose their children, they abandoned them\", he said.\nThe current management of Holt International has yet to respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nExperts say the responsibility lay not only with the private agencies but also with the state.\n\"Adoption agencies exploited the system, and the government turned a blind eye - allowing illegal practices to take root,\" said Dr Lee Kyung-eun, an international law scholar at Seoul National University.\n\"The government was the captain, and the agencies rowed the boat,\" said Shin Pil-sik, a researcher on transnational adoption at Seokyeong University, who added that this structure enabled both sides to deflect accountability.\nDr Shin said the state was not a passive observer- it actively shaped adoption policy, setting annual quotas for overseas placements and even on occasion halted some  adoptions.\nAn Associated Press news investigation last yearfound successive Korean governments had rewritten laws to remove minimal safeguards and judicial oversight, fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable, and allowed foreign families to adopt Korean children quickly without ever visiting the country.\nWhile the government billed the programme as a humanitarian effort, observers say it also served to strengthen ties with Western countries.\nA 1984 government document obtained by the BBC stated that the official goals of the adoption policy included not only the welfare of children but also \"the promotion of future national strength and people-to-people diplomacy\".\nWhen asked about the state's role in past adoption practices, South Korea's health and welfare ministry said they were \"continuing efforts to strengthen state responsibility\" in the system and that it plans to promote adoptions that comply with international standards.\nIn 2012, the government revised adoption laws to tighten screening of potential adoptive parents, and to track birthparent data and birth information better.\nIt has alsoenacted reforms to the adoption systemensuring that overseas adoptions are minimised and that all adoptions would be handled by the government instead of private agencies. The changes will take effect in July.\nMeanwhile, overseas adoptions have declined. In the late 1980s, overseas adoptions dropped sharply, before stabilising in the 1990s and dropping again in the 2010s. Only 79 children were adopted abroad in 2023, according to the latest available data.\nBut as South Korea begins to address this dark chapter in its past, adoptees and birth parents like Ms Han continue to struggle with their trauma.\nAfter their initial reunion, Ms Han and Kyung-ha have struggled to maintain a close connection.\nNot only do they live on opposite sides of the world, her daughter has forgotten most of her Korean while Ms Han knows little English.\nThey keep in touch over texts occasionally, and Ms Han spends two hours every day practising her English by writing phrases in an exercise book.\nBut it isn't enough for Ms Han.\n\"Even though I have found my daughter, it doesn't feel like I've truly found her. All I know is where she is, but what good is that, if we can't even communicate?\n\"My entire life has been ruined\u2026 no amount of money will ever make up for what I've lost.\"",

The world needs to see solidarity of 20,000 people in a park in London chanting, 'free free Palestine!'\"\nThe chant echoed out around Brixton's Brockwell Park.\nThe UN said on Friday thatGaza was in the \"cruellest phase\" of war,with 9,000 trucks' worth of aid ready at the border for the Palestinian territory.\n\"Let's remember how lucky we are to be in a field with our friends and not being bombed from the sky,\" Kneecap's frontman, who goes by the stage name Mo Chara, told the audience on Friday night.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the Palestinian group Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 53,762 people, including 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nFriday's concert - Kneecap's first big gig since the investigation was launched - followed a smaller \"secret\"set at London's 100 clubthe night before.\nIt saw the band - comprised of Chara, M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in) and balaclava-wearing beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh) - rip through tracks from their acclaimed album Fine Art, which has seen a surge in streaming in recent weeks since the controversy began.\nThis included a brand new track called The Recap which dropped online only hours earlier, and begins with a clip of a news report about the counter-terrorism investigation.\nFans, many of whom were wearing Irish and Palestinian flags and shirts, bounced and sang along to their tracks which find the west Belfast act rapping in English and Irish about everything from drug-fuelled parties to Northern Ireland and Gaza.\nOne such fan, Myrtle from Brighton, told BBC News she agreed with the band's views on Gaza.\n\"I think it's amazing. I think they're completely right,\" she said.\n\"Imagine in a few years if we get to a state where it's [even worse] and you can't say that you've been on the right side of history and you've not made an effort to make that change, how do you not feel guilty?\"\nShe added: \"Obviously it's led to one of them being charged with a terror offence which is awful, but it's brought more attention to the politics behind it.\"\nThe gig culminated in rousing renditions of Kneecap songs Get Your Brits out and H.O.O.D, with the band encouraging fans to bellow out the Irish Republican slogan \"Tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1\", which translates as \"our day will come\".\nBrixton resident John told us outside the gig: \"At best they're naive, at worst they're apologists for violence.\"\n\"Do they really know what Ireland was like before theGood Friday Agreement?\" he asked.\nAnother fan who lives in Orkney, Gwen, told us she had first come across Kneecap \"by accident\" when her sister told her about the band's nowBafta-winning film.\nShe lived in a kibbutz in Israel when she was younger. \"I've spent a lot of time in Israel, and I've had a lovely experience with Israeli people, and I've met Palestinian people in Israel,\" she explained.\n\"And the main thing that resonated with me when I was in Israel was that most people on the ground just kind of want peace. They don't like living with the constant fear of terror.\"\nShe said she \"loved Kneecap even more\" when they \"started putting their light on Gaza\".\nSpeaking at the Ivor Novello awards a day earlier, the composer of Kneecap's semi-autobiographical biopic, Michael \"Mikey J\" Asante, told the BBC's Mark Savage: \"I haven't really spoken to them, it's all pretty new - but more than anything else there's the notion of freedom of expression.\n\"It will all work out how it needs to. So you leave the people who have the information to make the right decisions.\"\n\u00d3 hAnnaidh seemed unconcerned about the law on the night, joking with fans that they would have to write to him in jail while asking them to get their \"grannies to light a wee candle for me\".\nTo their many fans, Kneecap are relatable, hedonistic provocateurs, mixing rapid-fire anti-establishment lyrics that aim to give a voice to the oppressed with danceable bass-heavy beats.\nTo their critics they are dangerous upstarts who have now gone too far.\nDuring an incendiaryperformance at the Coachella music festival in California last month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they have been called antisemitic and \"terrorist sympathisers\".\nThen in the UK, historic footage from two of their gigs wasassessed by counter-terrorism police. One appeared to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\" - both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them -  while another video allegedly showed them calling for Conservative MPs to be killed.\nKneecap apologised to the families of murdered MPsSir David Amess and Jo Cox but claimed footage of the incident had been taken out of context and \"exploited and weaponised\", adding they had have \"never supported\" Hamas or Hezbollah.\nThey repeated the claim they were \"being made an example of\" on stage on Friday.\nOrganisers of Friday's Brixton event confirmed in a statement earlier this month that the gig would go ahead after they had held \"positive discussions with key stakeholders\".\n\"Wide Awake Festival has a proud history of supporting the alternative music scene and we look forward to staging another unforgettable event showcasing the very best emerging and established talent,\" they said.\nBut other Kneecap gigs have been cancelled in the wake of the controversy, including their sets at the Eden Project in Cornwall and Plymouth Pavilions.\nPolice Scotland have saidthat allowing them to perform at the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow next month will require \"a significant policing operation\".\nSome politicians including Tory leader Kemi Badenoch have called for Kneecap to be banned and Commons Leader Lucy Powell has said the group should not be allowed to perform at Glastonbury next month, where they are listed for the Saturday.\nLiam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh is due to appear in court a week before the festival begins.\nArtists including CMAT, Massive Attack and Primal Scream as well as Paul Weller and DJ Annie Mac have all publicly defended Kneecap, saying the powers-that-be are \"strategically concocting moral outrage over the stage utterings of a young punk band\" while ignoring the situation in Gaza.",

        "author": "Max Matza",
        "body": "Investigators are examining whether foggy conditions and technical glitches at a San Diego airport that cut off lights meant to guide pilots may have played a role in a fatal plane crash.\nA Cessna 550 crashed early Thursday into a residential neighbourhood, burning cars and destroying at least one home.\nAuthorities say all six aboard are presumed dead, including a former drummer for the rock band The Devil Wears Prada and a high-profile music agent.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is examining a mix of clues and said the aircraft did not have a flight data recorder, which would have provided more information. Officials have not yet determined what factors led to the crash.\nIn a news conference on Friday, NTSB investigator Dan Baker said the agency is receiving help from the FBI as it works to collect and preserve evidence from the scene.\nHe said investigators have found the plane had struck high-tension power lines before crashing into homes in the Murphy Canyon neighbourhood, about two miles from the Montgomery Field Airport - where the plane was heading.\nThe airport, a small regional airport with three runways, was experiencing two separate issues at the time of the crash, Mr Baker said. The Automated Surface Observing Station, which provides weather data to pilots, was \"inoperative at the time of the accident due to an unrelated power surge\".\nAt the time, foggy conditions had been reported throughout the area.\nMr Baker attributed the outage to \"some sort of technical glitch\", but cautioned that it is unclear whether this contributed to the crash since not all airports are equipped with this system.\nThe airport also had filed a notice to pilots called a Notam, informing them that one of the runways had experienced an issue with the lighting system that guides landing planes.\nThe pilot of the downed plane had been aiming for that runway when the crash occurred, Mr Baker said.\nThe pilot did not report any issues to air control and never declared an emergency, Mr Baker said.\nThe Cessna was not equipped with a flight data recorder, and officials are investigating whether it may have had a cockpit voice recorder onboard.\nThe crash happened around 3:45 local time (10:45 GMT) and about 100 people had to be evacuated from the neighbourhood, which is just northeast of the city of San Diego.\nEight people on the ground were injured, including one who was taken to hospital.\nA preliminary report from the NTSB is expected to be released within 30 days, with a final report in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nThe names of four of the six people aboard the flight when it crashed have thus far been released.\nEmma Huke, 25, and Kendall Fortner, 24, were named as being on the plane by their employer, Sound Talent Group.\nFortner \"was the life of the party and lit up any room she entered,\" the company said in a statement on Friday.\nHuke was \"a beautiful soul who brought joy and a light to everyone in her presence\".\nThe company had earlier confirmed the death of its co-founder, prominent music agent Dave Shapiro. Shapiro had worked with rock groups including Sum 41, Story of the Year, Parkway Drive and singer Vanessa Carlton.\nHe was also an avid pilot and a certified flight instructor with 15 years of experience, according to his aviation company Velocity Aviation.\nFormer The Devil Wears Prada drummer Daniel Williams was also killed in the crash, members of the group confirmed in tributes posted online.\nIn the hours before the crash, he posted images on Instagram of himself and Shapiro sitting in the cockpit of the plane, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.\nWilliams was a founding member of The Devil Wears Prada and part of the Christian metal band for more than 10 years before parting ways in 2016.\nThe band posted a series of photos of Williams on Instagram, showing him with drumsticks, flying in an aircraft and various moments with fellow bandmates.\n\"no words. We owe you everything,\" the post reads. \"Love you forever.\"",

        "headline": "King's big moment in Canada after Trump row",
        "author": "Sean Coughlan",
        "body": "\"This is a big deal for the King to do this,\" says Jeremy Kinsman, former Canadian high commissioner to the UK, as King Charles prepares for a historic visit showing support for Canada, which is facing pressure from US President Donald Trump.\n\"I hope that Trump understands,\" says Mr Kinsman, ahead of the King becoming the first monarch to open Canada's Parliament in almost 70 years.\nSo what can we expect from his speech as Canada's head of state, to be delivered in French and English in Ottawa on Tuesday?\nIt will be written on the advice of Canada's government. But along with the workaday lines on policy plans, Mr Kinsman expects a message, loud and clear, that Canada will not be the US 51st state.\n\"It's going to be very affirmative of Canadian sovereignty. And I can say personally that it's something that King Charles will celebrate saying. I have no doubt,\" says Mr Kinsman, who worked as a diplomat with the King when he was Prince of Wales.\n\"It will say the government will protect, pursue and preserve the sovereignty of Canada as an independent state,\" he predicts about the speech, which follows anelection won by Mark Carney on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment.\nThe King's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, was the last monarch to open Canada's Parliament in 1957 and was also the most recent to deliver the \"speech from the throne\" in 1977, in a ceremony that marks the start of a parliamentary session.\nShe began that speech with a few of her own personal comments - so there is scope for the King to add his own thoughts.\n\"I don't know what pronoun they'll use. He'll be talking about the 'government proposes'. But I don't know if they'll throw in an \"I\". Either way he'll be identified with it,\" says Mr Kinsman about the personal nature of this speech from the King in Canada - a Commonwealth country and Nato partner.\nIt's going to be a more dressed-down event than the pomp of the Westminster state opening of Parliament. The King will be in a suit rather than a gown and crown, reading a speech that could last about 25 minutes, much of which will be about the government's legislative plans.\nThere are also likely to be nods to the importance of Canada's First Nations communities, in a speech that comes on the first visit to Canada from King Charles and Queen Camilla since the start of their reign.\nThe King, invited by Mr Carney, will have to balance a message of solidarity with Canada, without jeopardising the UK's relationship with the US.\n\"The King has long experience and great skill in walking that diplomatic tightrope,\" says a royal source.\n\"He's held in high regard around the globe and across the political spectrum, with good relations with world leaders who understand his unique position.\"\nMel Cappe, a former Canadian minister and senior civil servant, has been involved in preparing such speeches from the throne, usually delivered by a governor general.\nHe expects the King to add a \"few paragraphs of his own at the beginning\" to \"give his own personal view\", but the overall text of the speech will be approved by Canada's prime minister and his officials.\n\"He's not going to poke President Trump in the eye. That would cause a problem for Canada. On the other hand he isn't going to suck up to Donald Trump,\" says Prof Cappe, who was also a high commissioner to the UK.\nHe believes this intervention could have a big impact: \"Symbolically this is huge. President Trump has a lot of admiration for the monarchy. He is impressed by the royals.\"\nThis royal moment will be a platform for Canada's government to talk about tariffs and to mentionthe visit to the White House where PM Carney said Canada would \"never\" be for sale, says Prof Cappe.\n\"So somewhere in that speech, look for the word \"never\",\" he says.\nPresident Trump, as shown in his recent controversial White House meetings withSouth Africa's President RamaphosaandUkraine's President Zelensky,can be an unpredictable diplomatic partner.\n\"The old alliances are breaking down,\" says Mr Kinsman. And against a background of such uncertainty, King Charles has been part of an unexpected international balancing act.\nHe became a key part of the charm offensive to maintain the UK's good relations with President Trump, withan invite for a second state visit. Now he's going with a message of reassurance to the Canadians.\nSir Keir Starmer has been using the King to get closer to Trump, while Mark Carney is using him to keep Trump further away.\n\"He isn't anybody's tool or fool. This is something that he believes\u2026 It genuinely is something that he wants,\" says Mr Kinsman about the King's support for Canada.\nThe former diplomat remembers how much the then Prince Charles showed a personal affection for Canada and a sense of duty towards its people. A planned trip last year had to be cancelled because of his cancer diagnosis.\nThere are many strong links. The throne on which the King will sit to make his speech includes wood from Windsor Great Park - part of the Crown Estate.\nMr Kinsman says that many Canadians have been traumatised and upset by what he calls the \"appalling\" language of President Trump over wanting to take over Canada. It's shaken their view of the world and the new prime minister will be expected to stand up to the US.\nMr Carney has said thatCanadians were not \"impressed\" by the UK's invitation to President Trump for a state visit. But Mr Kinsman says that's Canadian understatement for being \"disgusted\" by the invitation. It really rankled.\nNonetheless he says that many Canadians are pragmatic enough to see the UK needs to keep good relations with the US and that the King - who is head  of state of both the UK and Canada - has to play both roles in this \"strange duality\".\nThat's rejected by Peter Donolo, a director of the Canadian International Council think tank, who believes there is an impossible contradiction in the King being different things for different countries.\n\"On the one hand they're using Charles in the UK to curry favour with the Americans and then it seems our government wants to use him to stand up for Canada. You can't have it both ways,\" says Mr Donolo.\nHe sees the monarchy as \"irrelevant\" to this dispute with the US. \"It won't have any impact on how Trump views Canada,\" says Mr Donolo.\nIn theory the King acts in two separate and distinct roles, taking advice from the UK government on UK matters and advice from the Canadian government in Canada. There are differences too. In Canada, the reference to the King as \"defender of the faith\" was scrapped from his title.\nElizabeth McCallion, who teaches political science at the University of Toronto, thinks many Canadians don't really have much interest in the constitutional complications around the role of the King.\nBut she says people in Canada were profoundly offended by Trump's aim to annexe their country - and were \"disappointed\" that they had relatively little backing from the UK, which seemed to be \"buddying up to Donald Trump\".\nThey're now watching to see what the King might say to support them.\n\"People are recognising that this is momentous,\" she says.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysisevery week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

        "headline": "Harvard foreign students face uncertainty as Trump plan to block enrolment is halted - for now",
        "author": "Mike Wendling and John Sudworth",
        "body": "A judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enrol foreign students.\nThe ruling came after Harvard filed a lawsuit - the latest escalation of a dispute between the White House and one of America's most prestigious institutions.\nThe university said theadministration's decision on Thursdayto bar international students was a \"blatant violation\" of the law and free speech rights.\nThe Trump administration says Harvard has not done enough to fight antisemitism, and change its hiring and admissions practices \u2013 allegations that the university has strongly denied.\nUS District Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order in a short ruling issued on Friday.\nThe order pauses a move that the Department of Homeland Security made on Thursday to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) - a government database that manages foreign students.\nThe next hearing will occur on 29 May in Boston.\n\"With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\" Harvard argued in the lawsuit.\n\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Harvard President Alan Garber said in a letter.\n\"The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,\" he wrote.\nIn response, White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said: \"If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus they wouldn't be in this situation to begin with.\nAfter the restraining order was issued, Ms Jackson accused the judge in the case of having a \"liberal agenda\".\n\"These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy,\" she said.\nIt was quiet at Harvard on Friday. Classes have finished for the year and preparations are being made for commencements. Gazebos were going up on the quad as students rented their gowns and collected tickets for family members.\nFor those graduating, it should be a week of celebration. But for foreign students hoping to remain in the US, it's been a 24-hour whirlwind.\nAll morning Harvard's international student body scrambled to find out what was going to happen. Would they have to leave the US immediately? Were they now under the threat of deportation?\nCormac Savage from Downpatrick in Co Down Northern Ireland is six days from graduating with a degree in government and languages. He's taking a job in Brussels, partly because of the uncertainty in the US.\n\"You know that you're fine if you're still legally in the United States for the next 90 days, but you don't know that you can come back and finish your degree,\" he said on Friday. \"You don't know if you can stay and work in the US if you're about to graduate.\nThe order also complicates plans for students still enroled, like Rohan Battula, a junior from the UK who will rely on his visa to work in New York in June.\n\"I was worried if I went home I wouldn't get to come back,\" he told BBC, so he opted to stay on campus.\nFor a group of international students gathered on the banks of the Charles River, as rowing teams sculled by, the relief was palpable when news came in of the reprieve from the Boston court.\nMr Battula also felt relieved after Judge Burroughs issued her order. But the uncertainty still is taking a toll.\n\"It's surreal to think that even for some period of time you're unlawfully staying in a country, just because you've been to university there,\" Mr Battula said.\nThere are around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolled students this year.\nAround a fifth of them are from China, with significant numbers from Canada, India, South Korea and the UK. Among the international students currently enrolled is the future queen of Belgium, 23-year-old Princess Elisabeth.\nLeo Ackerman was set to study education and entrepreneurship at Harvard beginning in August, fulfilling a \"dream\".\n\"I was really excited, and I'm still really excited if I manage to go there,\" Mr Ackerman said. \"Having it taken away feels like a really sad moment for a lot of people.\"\nEliminating foreign students would take a large bite out of Harvard's finances. Experts say international students are more likely to pay full tuition, essentially subsidising aid for American students.\nUndergraduate tuition - not including fees, housing, books, food or health insurance - will reach $59,320 (\u00a343,850) in the coming academic year, according to the university. The total cost of a year at Harvard before any financial aid is usually significantly more than $100,000.\nIsaac Bangura, a public administration student from Sierra Leone, moved to  Harvard with his wife and two young daughters after surviving a civil war.\n\"Since yesterday, my kids has been asking, 'Daddy, I understand they are coming to return us home again.' They are referring to deportation,\" he said.\nHe said he has to be strong for them and has faith. \"I know the American people are always, whenever they are into issues, they will find ways of resolving it,\" he said.\nIn addition to Harvard, the Trump administration has taken aim at other elite institutions, not only arguing that they should do more to clamp down on pro-Palestinian activists but also claiming they discriminate against conservative viewpoints.\nOn Friday, speaking from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said, \"Harvard is going to have to change its ways\" and suggested he is considering measures against more universities.\nIn April, theWhite House froze $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) in federal funding to Harvard, and Trump has threatened to remove the university's tax-exempt status, a standard designation for US educational institutions.\nThe funding freeze prompted anearlier Harvard lawsuit, also asking the courts to stop the administration's actions.\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said federal courts in Massachusetts and New England, where the initial stages of the case will play out, have consistently ruled against the Trump administration.\nBut the outcome may be less predictable in the US Supreme Court, where Harvard's case may end up.\n\"These are tough issues for Harvard, but they have the resources and they seem to have the will to fight,\" Mr Tobias said.\nHarvard leaders have made concessions to the White House - including dismissing the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, who came under fire for failing to represent Israeli perspectives.\nBut it also enlisted several high-profile Republican lawyers, including Robert Hur, a former special counsel who investigated Joe Biden's retention of classified documents.\nForeign students currently attending Harvardhave expressed worries that the rowcould force them to transfer to another university or return home. Being logged on the SEVP system is a requirement for student visas and, if Harvard is blocked from the database, students could be found in violation and potentially face deportation.\nSeveral British students enrolled at Harvard, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity out of fear of immigration authorities, worried their US education could be cut short.\n\"I definitely think freedom of speech is a problem on campus, but it's being actively worked on... it was an absolute shock when yesterday's announcement happened,\" said one student\n\"There's a lot of anger, people feeling like we're being used as pawns in a game.\"\nWith reporting from Kayla Epstein in New York, Bernd Debusmann at the White House and the BBC's User Generated Content team\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weeklyUS Politics Unspunnewsletter.

        "author": "Annabel Deas, Hayley Mortimer and Kirstie Brewer",
        "body": "A former British soldier who became a people smuggler has told the BBC how he transported dozens of Vietnamese migrants by yacht into private marinas in seaside towns across south-east England.\nThe man was convicted and sent to prison in 2019, but we have learned that smugglers are still using similar routes and methods - described by Border Force as \"a really concerning risk\".\nPrivate marinas have \"no more security than a caravan site\", one harbourmaster on the Essex coast told us - while another said \"there is nothing to stop this [people smuggling] happening\".\nThe ex-soldier and smuggler, who we are calling Nick, has also been describing how he smuggled Albanian people in cars on to ferries - and how the migrants then jumped into lorries on the vehicle decks mid-journey in the English Channel.\nThe smuggling routes - whether by yacht or ferry - were \"easy\" and \"low risk\", Nick told us.\nHe said he had chosen to speak out now because he was \"angry\" he had been jailed for a crime that was still very possible to commit. He claimed to know people who, in the past year, had used the same routes and methods as him.\nConvicting him was \"pointless\", he said, if the authorities would not improve security to stop other people smugglers.\nBorder Force is responsible for securing the 11,000 miles of UK coastline, but the security of harbours and marinas rests with private operators, Charlie Eastaugh, the force's director of maritime, told the BBC.\n\"We patrol 24/7, we carry out proactive, as well as reactive, operations,\" he said - citing a luxury yacht, hiding 20 Albanians below deck, that was intercepted en route to Newquay in Cornwall last month.\nNick's story is a particularly striking example of how a British citizen became involved in the international people-smuggling trade.\nHis \"stories and confessions represent a concerning risk posed to the UK around people smuggling and irregular migration at sea\", said Border Force's Charlie Eastaugh. We will \"look at the vulnerabilities he [Nick] has identified,\" he added.\nUnlike many migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, the majority of those transported by Nick did not want to be found by authorities to formally claim asylum. Having arrived on UK shores, they wanted to disappear anonymously into the black economy. Nick said he had been told the Vietnamese migrants would go on to work on cannabis farms.\nThe fact that Nick travelled with them too - skippering a yacht - is also unusual.\nIt all started in 2009, when an Albanian friend he met on a construction site recruited him - saying Nick's pale complexion and UK passport would help him to avoid suspicion from border authorities.\nThe friend, whom we are calling Matt, offered to pay Nick \u00a33,500 for every migrant he smuggled into the UK. Nick was working as a self-employed builder at the time, but his business had been pulled under by the financial crash in the late 2000s and he was struggling to make ends meet. He also had a baby on the way and was desperate to provide for them, he told us.\nMatt spoke briefly to the BBC and confirmed details of Nick's story - but we did not move forward with a full interview because he demanded payment.\nAt first, Nick picked up migrants hiding near French ferry ports, concealing them in the boot of his car.\nThe migrants tended to be Albanian men, he told us, with no right to work in the UK. Often they had been smuggled across the English Channel three or four times previously, only to be deported each time, he added. Some of his other passengers, from places such as Sri Lanka, were looking to claim asylum however, he told us.\nOn the ferry, Nick would pick a lorry that another smuggling-gang member waiting on dry land would spot easily. Nick said he would send them a photo and share the vehicle's number plate.\nYou then tell the migrant to get on top of the lorry, he explained. \"You give him a knife\u2026 just cut one side like a V, you slide in.\"\nThe waiting gang member would then trail the lorry once it disembarked and collect the migrant when it eventually stopped. The lorry driver would have had no idea or involvement, said Nick.\n\"I'm telling you now how easy it is,\" he told us - insisting he would never have been caught, had it not been for a friend, whom he had taken along one day, alerting the French authorities with suspicious body language. Nick ended up spending five months in a prison in France.\nMatt, meanwhile, was also eventually caught and given a seven-year UK prison sentence. It had happened after a migrant jumped off a fast-moving lorry, to avoid paying the smuggler, and severed his foot.\nNick was reunited with Matt, who was granted early release, in 2017 and the pair began smuggling people across the Channel again.\nThis time however, Nick told us he took charge of a plan that saw Vietnamese migrants arrive from France by yacht at Ramsgate Marina.\nThe operation was brokered by one of Matt's contacts, Nick told us, a Vietnamese woman we are calling Lin. She had lived in the UK for more than a decade and had spent time behind bars for growing cannabis and removing the proceeds of drug trafficking.\nNick said she paid him and Matt \u00a312,000 per migrant.\nNick, who grew up sailing the English Channel with his father, told us he knew Ramsgate Marina was a big, low-security place which \"no-one watched\". As he was a registered member of the marina, there was no reason for anyone to suspect wrongdoing, he explained.\nIt was also a good place to keep tabs on the comings and goings of Border Force agents, he told us, because a fleet of the force's boats was based there too.\n\"People are going to hate me because there'll be smuggling going on now,\" said Nick, who insists private marinas in English seaside towns are still hotspots. \"When they hear this, there's going to be an issue.\"\nTwo harbourmasters, speaking anonymously to the BBC, agreed with Nick that private marinas were an easy target for people-smugglers because they were not manned 24/7.\nOne based in Essex likened security to a caravan site and said that someone could hide people in a boat \"easily\".\n\"In a busy marina in peak season, with a lot of people coming in and out, it would be very easy to do this,\" they said.\nIn Kent, Thanet District Council - which is responsible for Ramsgate Marina - told us it was Border Force, and not individual harbours, that was \"the front line response for immigration and illegal activities\".\n\"Staff at the port and harbour are vigilant and report any concerns or suspicions directly to Border Force for them to follow up,\" said a spokesperson.\nThere are hundreds of harbours and marinas in the UK and it would not be a reasonable expectation for Border Force to have a fixed presence at all of them, said the force's Charlie Eastaugh.\nBut we do receive \"really good information\" from the maritime community which the force responds to, he added. \"We need to be able to respond to intelligence so we can proportionately use our resources around the whole of the UK.\"\nWe also spoke to former Border Force chief Tony Smith, who told us the \"vast majority\" of the agency's resources were currently deployed to the Small Boats Operational Command - focusing on specific routes used by large numbers of people crowded into small craft.\n\"My preference certainly would be to be able to deploy more widely and to look more across the whole of the UK coastline to identify threats,\" he said, adding he thought the BBC's conversations with Nick would be \"really, really helpful as another source of intelligence\".\nMore than 12,500 people have crossed the English Channel on small boats so far in 2025 - anda record number of migrants diedwhile attempting to make the dangerous crossing in 2024.\nSmall-boat crossings are different from what Nick was doing because most of those migrants want to be seen and rescued by Border Force to claim asylum in the UK. Smugglers are not on the boats, which are instead often manned by migrants who get discounts on their fees.\nThe numbers of migrants involved in an operation like Nick's are harder to pin down because there are no published estimates of how many illegal immigrants enter the UK through small ports, marinas and harbours.\nNick told us he would carefully plan his trips to France around favourable tides and weather conditions - setting sail from Kent after dark. He would head for private marinas, yacht clubs and other discreet locations around Dunkirk to collect the Vietnamese migrants who had been driven from a Paris safehouse. He would normally smuggle four per trip, he said.\nHe would return back to Ramsgate in the early hours before it got light, he told us. The migrants would stay hidden inside the boat's cabin until the next evening, when one of the smuggling gang would collect them under the cover of darkness.\nBut there were occasions when he had to escape prying eyes, Nick recalled. For a time, he had to switch from Ramsgate to a different marina because one of the harbour staff told him there had been \"foreigners\" around his boat, having spotted some of the Vietnamese migrants.\nHe managed to continue his ruse, however, for up to 18 months before being caught.\nA police unit tasked with tackling serious organised crime had been watching him and Matt for months. In late summer 2018, officers spotted Nick sail into view with four Vietnamese men in his boat. Nick was charged with conspiracy to facilitate the illegal entry of foreign nationals into the UK and later sentenced to eight years in prison.\nLin, the Vietnamese woman who had been paying him, got the same sentence. They both denied the charges, whereas Matt, the Albanian, pled guilty and was given a lesser sentence of five years and four months.\n\"I regret a lot of it, but I don't know that it would have ever been any different,\" said Nick, reflecting on his time in the people-smuggling trade.\n\"I think I was always out for self-destruction anyway.\"\nHe was recently recalled to prison for breaching the terms of his licence. Matt and Lin, meanwhile, are both out of prison and living in the UK.",

        "headline": "As Israel faces diplomatic 'tsunami', Trump is staying quiet",
        "author": "Paul Adams",
        "body": "A headline in Israel's liberal daily Ha'aretz this week put it starkly: \"Diplomatic tsunami nears,\" it warned, \"as Europe begins to act against Israel's 'complete madness' in Gaza.\"\nThis week's diplomatic assault has taken many forms, not all of them foreseen.\nFrom concerted international condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza, to the shocking murder of two young Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, this has been, to put it mildly, a tumultuous week for the Jewish state.\nThe waves started crashing on Israel's shores on Monday evening, when Britain, France and Canada issued a joint statement condemning its \"egregious\" actions in Gaza.\nAll three warned of the possibility of \"further concrete actions\" if Israel continued its renewed military offensive and failed to lift restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nThey also threatened \"targeted sanctions\" in response to Israel's settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.\nA statement from 24 donor nations followed, condemning a new, Israeli-backed aid delivery model for Gaza.\nBut that was just the start.\nOn Tuesday, Britain suspended trade talks with Israel and said a 2023 road map for future cooperation was being reviewed.\nA fresh round of sanctions was imposed on Jewish settlers, including Daniela Weiss, a prominent figure who featured in Louis Theroux's recent documentary, The Settlers.\nIsrael's ambassador in London, Tzipi Hotovely, was summoned to the Foreign Office, a move generally reserved for the representatives of countries like Russia and Iran.\nTo make matters worse for Israel, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said a \"strong majority\" of the bloc's members favoured reviewing the 25-year-old Association Agreement with Israel.\nThe reasons for this flurry of diplomatic condemnation seemed clear enough.\nEvidence that Gaza was closer to mass starvation than at any time since the war began, following Hamas's attack in October 2023, was sending ripples of horror across the world.\nIsrael's military offensive, and the rhetoric surrounding it, suggested that conditions in the stricken territory were about to deteriorate once more.\nAddressing MPs on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy singled out the words of Israel's hardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who had spoken of \"cleansing\" Gaza, \"destroying what's left\" and relocating the civilian population to third countries.\n\"We must call this what it is,\" Lammy said. \"It's extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous. And I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\"\nSmotrich is not a decision-maker when it comes to conduct of the war in Gaza. Before now, his incendiary remarks might have been set to one side.\nBut those days appear to be over. Rightly or wrongly, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seen as in thrall to his far-right colleagues. Critics accuse him of relentlessly pursuing a war, without regard for the lives of Palestinian civilians or the remaining Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.\nCountries that have long supported Israel's right to defend itself are beginning to say \"enough is enough.\"\nThis week was clearly a significant moment for Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, a staunch defender of Israel (he once said \"I support Zionism without qualification\") who faced strong criticism from within the Labour Party for his reluctance last year to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nOn Tuesday, Sir Keir said the suffering of innocent children in Gaza was \"utterly intolerable\".\nIn the face of this unusually concerted action from some of his country's strongest allies, Netanyahu reacted furiously, suggesting Britain, France and Canada were guilty of supporting Hamas.\n\"When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice,\" he posted on X.\n\"You're on the wrong side of humanity and you're on the wrong side of history.\"\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar went further, suggesting there was a \"direct line\" between Israel's critics, including Starmer, and Wednesday night's killing of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, the two Israeli embassy employees gunned down outside the Jewish Museum in Washington.\nBut despite the outpourings of sympathy following the shooting, the Israeli government seems increasingly isolated, with western allies and prominent members of the Jewish diaspora all voicing anger \u2013 and anguish \u2013 over the war in Gaza.\nLord Levy, former Middle East envoy and advisor to Tony Blair, said he endorsed the current government's criticisms, even suggesting they might have come \"a little late\".\n\"There has to be a stand, not just from us in this country but internationally, against what is going on in Gaza,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One, describing himself as \"a very proud Jew\u2026who passionately cares for Israel\".\nBut silent, throughout all this, is the one man who could, if he wanted, stop the war.\nAt the end of his recent tour of the Gulf, Donald Trump said \"a lot of people are starving\".\nWhite House officials indicated the US president was frustrated with the war and wanted the Israeli government to \"wrap it up\".\nBut while other western leaders release expressions of outrage, Trump is saying almost nothing.",

        "headline": "'We did not sign up for this': Harvard's foreign students are stuck and scared",
        "author": "Kelly Ng & Annabelle Liang",
        "body": "When Shreya Mishra Reddy was admitted to Harvard University in 2023, her parents were \"ecstatic\".\nIt is \"the ultimate school that anybody in India wants to get into,\" she tells the BBC.\nNow, with graduation around the corner, she has had to break the bad news to her family: she may not graduate in July from the executive leadership programme afterthe Trump administration moved to stop Harvard from enrolling international students\"as a result of their failure to adhere to the law\".\n\"It has been very difficult for my family to hear. They're still trying to process it,\" she said.\nMs Reddy is one of around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolments this year. They are a crucial source of revenue for the Ivy League school. About a third of its foreign students are from China, and more than 700 are Indian, such as Ms Reddy.\nAll of them are now unsure of what to expect next. Harvard has called the move \"unlawful\", which could lead to a legal challenge.\nBut that leaves the students' futures in limbo, be it those who are waiting to enrol this summer, or are halfway through college, or even those awaiting graduation whose work opportunities are tied to their student visas.\nThose who are already at Harvard would have to transfer to other American universities to remain in the US and retain their visas.\n\"I hope Harvard will stand for us and some solution can be worked out,\" Ms Reddy says.\nThe university has said it is \"fully committed to maintaining [its] ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably\".\nThe move against Harvard has huge implications for the million or so international students in the US. And it follows a growing crackdown by the Trump administration on institutes of higher learning, especially those that witnessed major pro-Palestinian protests on campus.\nDozens of them are facing investigations, as the government attempts to overhaul their accreditation process and reshape the way they are run.\nThe White Housefirst threatened to bar foreign students from Harvardin April, after the university refused to make changes to its hiring, admissions and teaching practices. And it also froze nearly $3bn in federal grants, which Harvard is challenging in court.\nStill, Thursday's announcement - which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said came because they were allegedly \"fostering violence\" and \"antisemitism\" - left students reeling.\nChinese student Kat Xie, who is in her second year in a STEM programme, says she is \"in shock\".\n\"I had almost forgotten about [the earlier threat of a ban] and then Thursday's announcement suddenly came.\"\nBut she adds a part of her had expected \"the worst\", so she had spent the last few weeks seeking professional advice on how to continue staying in the US.\nBut the options are \"all very troublesome and expensive\", she says.\nHarvard has been given 72 hours to comply with a list of demands to have an \"opportunity\" to regain its ability to enrol these students, including providing the government with all disciplinary records for non-immigrant students enrolled at Harvard over the past five years.\nNoem also demanded Harvard turn over electronic records, videos, or audio of \"illegal\" and \"dangerous or violent\" activity by non-immigrant students on campus.\nBut the Trump administration also appeared to single China out when Noem also accused Harvard of \"coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party\" in her statement.\nBeijing responded on Friday by criticising the \"politicisation\" of education.\nIt said the move would \"only harm the image and international standing of the United States\", urging for the ban to be withdrawn \"as soon as possible\".\n\"None of this is what we've signed up for,\" says 20-year-old Abdullah Shahid Sial from Pakistan, a very vocal student activist.\nA junior majoring in applied mathematics and economics, he was one of only two Pakistani undergraduate students admitted to Harvard in 2023.\nHe was also the first person in his family to study abroad. It was a \"massive\" moment for them, he says.\nThe situation he now finds himself in, he adds, is \"ridiculous and dehumanising\".\nBoth Ms Reddy and Mr Sial said foreign students apply to go to college in the US because they see it as a welcoming place where opportunities abound.\n\"You have so much to learn from different cultures, from people of different backgrounds. And everybody really valued that,\" Ms Reddy says, adding that this had been her experience at Harvard so far.\nBut Mr Sial says that has changed more recently and foreign students no longer feel welcome - the Trump administrationhas revoked hundreds of student visas and even detained students on campusesacross the country. Many of them were linked to pro-Palestinian protests.\nNow, Mr Sial adds, there is a lot of fear and uncertainty in the international student community.\nThat has only been exacerbated by the latest development. A postgraduate student from South Korea says she is having second thoughts about going home for the summer because she fears she won't be able to re-enter the US.\nShe did not want to reveal her name because she is worried that might affect her chances of staying in the US. She is one year away from graduating.\nShe said she had a gruelling semester and had been looking forward to \"reuniting with friends and family\" - until now.\nThe anxiety among foreign students is palpable, says Jiang Fangzhou, who is reading public administration in Harvard Kennedy School.\n\"We might have to leave immediately but people have their lives here - apartments, leases, classes and community. These are not things you can walk away from overnight.\"\nAnd the ban doesn't just affect current students, the 30-year-old New Zealander says.\n\"Think about the incoming ones, people who already turned down offers from other schools and planned their lives around Harvard. They're totally stuck now.\"\nAdditonal reporting by Mengchen Zhang",

        "headline": "Rebuked by Trump but praised at home:  How Ramaphosa might gain from US showdown",
        "author": "Nick Ericsson",
        "body": "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and his delegation went to Washington this week hoping for a boost and a reset after months of acrimony with the Donald Trump administration.\nInstead they got brutal, high-stakes diplomacy, peppered with insults, and played out to millions across the world in real time. It was like a painful job review carried out by a boss on a loud hailer.\nPraised by many for remaining composed and reconciliatory in the face of an exercised Trump, while also criticised by some for not responding more forcefully to Tump's accusations, reality awaits Ramaphosa back in South Africa where he and his African National Congress (ANC) face pressures on multiple fronts.\nThe ANC has been in an uneasy coalition - or government of national unity (GNU) - with 10 other parties for almost a year, forced into sharing power after dismal results in national elections.\nThere have been public fights between parties inside and outside the coalition over controversial land and healthcare legislation and attempts to push a budget through parliament which would hike taxes for the most vulnerable. That almost saw the end of the coalition earlier this year.\nThe economy is stagnating, crime rates are sky-high as is corruption and unemployment, public services are largely dysfunctional and infrastructure is crumbling. There also seems to be very little accountability for those who break the law.\nThis has meant uncomfortable and intense questions about Ramaphosa's policies by various political parties, as well as civil society.\nMeanwhile the ANC itself is unstable, as opposing factions begin jockeying for position ahead of a crucial elective conference in 2027 which is likely to see a new party leader emerge.\nAt the same time, Ramaphosa's loudest critics, such as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema - who featured prominently in Trump's discredited dossier of \"evidence\" that genocide was being committed against white Afrikaners in South Africa - as well as former President Jacob Zuma, have been getting louder still.\nSo Ramaphosa was looking for a trade deal, desperately needing the business and stability this would bring to South Africa to stimulate real and lasting economic growth and put people back to work.\nRamaphosa said as much to Trump on Wednesday - that US investment was needed to help tackle the joblessness that was a key factor in the country's high crime rate.\nThe risk that theAgoa trade deal with the USmay not be renewed later this year because of Trump's isolationist worldview have made this all the more urgent. This gave South Africa duty-free access to the US market for certain goods, and is credited with having boosted South Africa's fragile economy.\nBut the talk of trade was overshadowed by Trump's Oval Office ambush over discredited claims that white South Africans were being persecuted.\nHowever, there may still be a silver lining for Ramaphosa, and by extension his party, at least domestically.\nYes, the to-do list is impossibly long, and yes the pressure for the South African president to hold a coalition and party together that is messy and deeply uncomfortable will be waiting for him on his return. And yes the ANC is in the weakest position since it came to power 30 years ago. But it's still in power, even if it's sharing it.\nCrucially, Ramaphosa's conduct with Trump reminded South Africans of his diplomatic pedigree, and of his importance to the country's rules-based order.\nHe is, along with Nelson Mandela, South Africa's greatest ever alliance builder and facilitator. He was at the nerve centre of negotiating an end to the racist system of apartheid in the early 1990s, and in keeping South Africa together when many had prophesised its fatal fracture. He has stayed calm, smiled and faced down far more bitter opponents before.\nMore recently, he steered the country out of the bleak\"state capture\"years of the Zuma administration and then through the difficult Covid lockdowns. And also kept the ANC on its feet - just - when it hobbled home after the 2024 elections. He then he took a wounded ANC into coalition politics and survived as president despite opposition from within his own party.\n\"I believe if a snap poll was done today, we would see his personal ratings go up,\" says South African editor and founder of explain.co.za Verashni Pillay.\n\"He excels in these high-pressure situations. He has this wealth of negotiating experience in arguably far more tense environments where there has been actual blood on the streets and imminent civil war. That's why you saw him looking particularly relaxed. He's masterful at diffusing tension at key moments.\"\nSurveys have consistently referenced the Ramaphosa Effect - themost recentfrom the Social Research Foundation last month which suggests that without him, the ANC would haemorrhage support even more than it already has, despite equally consistent criticism of the South African president that he is too slow and indecisive in tackling the country's biggest problems. To a large extent, that's still the case.\nBut events this week, ostensibly meant to bully, ridicule and embarrass Ramaphosa around the world, actually reminded many South Africans of what he brings to the government and the country - a constant, stable and predictable centre.\n\"I think what happened in the Oval Office has reinforced the idea of 'If not Ramaphosa then who?'\" says Pillay.\nIn fact, some think that what South Africans saw in the White House will actually strengthen the GNU - backed as it is by big business, which will ultimately reassure South Africans who were watching the drama.\n\"The meeting displayed a united front from South Africa, a public-private performance that the country has been promoting for over a decade. This for the GNU is great political theatre that translates into political capital,\" says Itumeleng Makgetla, a political analyst at the University of Pretoria.\nAnd indeed, the optics were all there. Ramaphosa facilitated a passionate rebuttal of the worst of Trump's misinformation through interventions from his partner in the GNU - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen - and one of South Africa's wealthiest people, Johann Rupert - both white South Africans. If Trump understood the power of performance, so too did Ramaphosa.\n\"I do think the GNU comes out of this looking quite strong,\" says Pillay. \"The GNU happened at a really good moment for South Africa ahead of this crisis. If it was just the ANC government in the room, [Ramaphosa's arguments] wouldn't have landed. But being able to say that we have these parties that represent white people in government is such a strong statement.\"\nSo what does this all mean for those on the extreme flanks of South African politics and discourse?\nAfter the lights dimmed, Julius Malema was shown by Trump singing a song that some say calls for the murder of white farmers, although a court has ruled it is just political rhetoric. Might he reap domestic political capital from being thrust into the global spotlight?\nYes, say some. \"For those in the country that are quite tired of the diatribe from President Trump and the US\u2026 this will likely strengthen Malema [and] parties like the MK because it'll basically be saying: 'Look, surely we can't be bending over backwards for such individuals and lies,'\" says South African political analyst Prof Kagiso \"TK\" Pooe from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\nBut Pillay disagrees.\n\"This will not translate into political power for Malema.  Most of his top leaders have alreadydefected to Jacob Zuma's MK party. Things for the EFF were not looking good, even before Wednesday. Julius Malema's brand of politics, of wanting everything to burn down, of blaming white people for everything... is entertaining but it hasn't won votes because most South Africans don't want their country to be burnt down.\"\nHaving said that, there is a sizeable group of South Africans who want faster and more radical change - the election results for the MK party, a breakaway faction of the ANC, shows that.\nAnd what of Afriforum - the Afrikaner interest group that tugged at the ears of Trump's supporters for a number of years by lobbying and spreading right-wing propaganda, hoping to be heard?\nTrump's discredited audio-visual presentation of what he said was the systematic extermination of white Afrikaner farmers was the high-water mark of their lobbying efforts, amplified as they were in the Oval Office.\nYet, despite extraordinarily high levels of violent crime in South Africa, many are angry at the group. \"In a way, I think a lot of South Africans - even those that don't support the ANC - can finally see that there are certain people that are not for South Africa. Those people have been singled out and that's a positive in a way,\" says Prof Pooe.\n\"We know a large number of Afrikaans speakers are people of colour,\" says Pillay. \"Afriforum dealt a severe blow to the cause of Afrikaners in South Africa by racialising it.\"\nAfriforum's Kallie Kriel has defended the group's conduct on a local television channel, Newzroom Afrika: \"It wasn't Afriforum chanting genocidal calls for someone to be killed. If President Ramaphosa went there to tell the Americans that they don't know what's going on, they will see that as an insult because they have an embassy in South Africa and a State Department and intelligence services,\" he said.\nAs the dust settles from Wednesday's drama, Ramaphosa will be watching and calculating. He has consistently been at the centre of key inflection points in recent South African history when some kind of a rupture has occurred and the country has had to change course dramatically. He reads these moments so well.\nWednesday's upheaval in Trump's White House may not have been the economic and diplomatic reset with the US that was hoped, but could yet mark a dramatic reset for Ramaphosa and the GNU with the South African public.\nAdditional reporting by Khanyisile Ngcobo in Johannesburg\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica",

        "headline": "Can Donald Trump build the 'Golden Dome' over the US?",
        "author": "Bernd Debusmann Jr",
        "body": "Warheads raining down from beyond the Earth's atmosphere. Faster-than-sound cruise missiles striking US infrastructure. Sky-high nuclear blasts.\nThese are just some of the nightmarish scenarios that experts warn could come true if the US's dated and limited defence systems were overwhelmed in a future high-tech attack.\nEven a single, relatively small nuclear detonation hundreds of miles above the heads of Americans would create an electromagnetic pulse - or EMP - that would have apocalyptic results. Planes would fall out of the sky across the country. Everything from handheld electronics and medical devices to water systems would be rendered completely useless.\n\"We wouldn't be going back 100 years,\" said William Fortschen, an author and weapons researcher at Montreat College in North Carolina. \"We'd lose it all, and we don't know how to rebuild it. It would be the equivalent of us going back 1,000 years and having to start from scratch.\"\nIn response to these hypothetical - but experts say quite possible - threats, US President Donald Trump has set his eyes on a \"next generation\" missile shield: the Golden Dome.\nBut while many experts agree that building such a system is necessary, its high cost and logistical complexity will make Trump's mission to bolster America's missile defences extremely challenging.\nAn executive order calling for the creation of what was initially termed the \"Iron Dome for America\" noted that the threat of next-generation weapons has \"become more intense and complex\" over time, a potentially \"catastrophic\" scenario for the US.\nPatrycja Bazylczyk, a missile defence expert at the Washington DC-headquartered Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the BBC that existing systems are geared towards intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, such as those used by North Korea. But powerful nations like Russia and China are also investing in newer technologies that could strike not just neighbours, but adversaries an ocean away.\nAmong the threats publicly identified by US defence officials arehypersonic weapons able to move faster than the speed of soundand fractional orbital bombardment systems - also called Fobs - that could deliver warheads from space.\nEach - even in limited numbers - are deadly.\n\"The Golden Dome sort of re-orients our missile defence policy towards our great power competitors,\" Ms Bazylczyk said. \"Our adversaries are investing in long-range strike capabilities, including things that aren't your typical missiles that we've been dealing with for years.\"\nThe White House and defence officials have so far provided few concrete details about what the Golden Dome - which is still in its conceptual stages - would actually look like.\nSpeaking alongside Trump in the Oval Office on 20 May, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said only that the system will have multiple layers \"across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors\".\nTrump added that the system will be capable of intercepting missiles \"even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched in space\", with various aspects of the programme based as far afield as Florida, Indiana and Alaska.\nIn previous testimony in Congress, the newly named overseer of the programme, Space Force General Michael Guetlein, said that the Golden Dome will build on existing systems that are largely aimed at traditional ICBMs. A new system would - add multiple layers that could also detect and defend against cruise missiles and other threats, including by intercepting them before they launch or at the various stages of their flight.\nCurrently, the US Missile Defence Agency largely relies on 44 ground-based interceptors based in Alaska and California, designed to combat a limited missile attack.\nExperts have warned that the existing system is woefully inadequate if the US homeland were to be attacked by Russia and China, each of which has an expanded arsenal of hundreds of ICBMs and thousands of cruise missiles.\n\"[Current systems] were created for North Korea,\" said Dr Stacie Pettyjohn, a defence expert at the Center for a New American Security. \"It could never intercept a big arsenal like Russia's, or even a much smaller one like China's.\"\nThe Congressional Research Office, or CBO, has said that \"hundreds or thousands\" of space-based platforms would be necessary to \"provide even a minimal defence\" against incoming missiles  - a potentially enormously expensive proposition.\nTrump first revealed his concept for the Golden Dome during a joint address to Congress in March, when he said that \"Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too\".\nThe president was referring toIsrael's \"Iron Dome\" system, which the country has used to intercept rockets and missiles since 2011.\nIsrael's Iron Dome, however, is designed to intercept shorter-range threats, while two other systems - known as David's Sling and the Arrow - combat larger ballistic missiles such as those that have been fired by Iran and the Houthis in Yemen.\nMs Bazylczyk described the Iron Dome as geared towards \"lower tier\" threats, such as rockets fired from Gaza or southern Lebanon.\nThe Golden Dome would go beyond that, to detect longer range missiles as well, she said.\nTo accomplish that, she said it will need to combine different capabilities.\n\"And I'll be looking out for the command and control system that can weave all of this together,\" she said, noting that such a thing does not currently exist.\nCreating that system will be an incredibly complicated - and costly - proposition.\nIn the Oval Office, Trump suggested that the Golden Dome could be completed by the end of his term, with a total cost of $175bn over time, including an initial investment of $25bn already earmarked for it.\nHis estimate is far out of sync with the CBO's, which has put the potential price tag at $542bn over 20 years on the space-based systems alone. Experts have said the total cost could eventually soak up a large chunk of the massive US defence budget.\n\"I think that's unrealistic,\" said Dr Pettyjohn. \"This is complicated, with multiple systems that need to be integrated together. Every one of those steps has its own risks, costs and schedules.\"\n\"And going fast is going to add more cost and risk,\" she added. \"You're likely to produce something that isn't going to be as thoroughly evaluated... there are going to be failures along the way, and what you produce may need major overhauls.\"\nThe creation of the Golden Dome has also sparked fears that it may lead to a new \"arms race\", with US foes gearing up their own efforts to find ways to overwhelm or circumvent its defences.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning, for example, told reporters that the plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield\".\nThose involved in researching worst-case scenarios and US defence policy downplay these concerns. Potential foes, they argue, are already investing heavily in offensive capabilities.\n\"The Golden Dome aims to change the strategic calculus of our adversaries,\" said Ms Bazylczyk. \"Improving homeland air and missile defences reduces the confidence of a potential attacker in achieving whatever objectives they seek.\"\n\"It raises the threshold for them to engage in this attack,\" she added. \"And it contributes to overall deterrence.\"\nEven a partially completed Golden Dome, Mr Fortschen said, could prevent a nightmare scenario from taking place.\n\"I will breathe a lot easier,\" he said. \"We need that type of system. The Golden Dome is the answer.\"",

        "headline": "As Israel faces diplomatic 'tsunami', Trump is staying quiet",
        "author": "Paul Adams",
        "body": "A headline in Israel's liberal daily Ha'aretz this week put it starkly: \"Diplomatic tsunami nears,\" it warned, \"as Europe begins to act against Israel's 'complete madness' in Gaza.\"\nThis week's diplomatic assault has taken many forms, not all of them foreseen.\nFrom concerted international condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza, to the shocking murder of two young Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, this has been, to put it mildly, a tumultuous week for the Jewish state.\nThe waves started crashing on Israel's shores on Monday evening, when Britain, France and Canada issued a joint statement condemning its \"egregious\" actions in Gaza.\nAll three warned of the possibility of \"further concrete actions\" if Israel continued its renewed military offensive and failed to lift restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nThey also threatened \"targeted sanctions\" in response to Israel's settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.\nA statement from 24 donor nations followed, condemning a new, Israeli-backed aid delivery model for Gaza.\nBut that was just the start.\nOn Tuesday, Britain suspended trade talks with Israel and said a 2023 road map for future cooperation was being reviewed.\nA fresh round of sanctions was imposed on Jewish settlers, including Daniela Weiss, a prominent figure who featured in Louis Theroux's recent documentary, The Settlers.\nIsrael's ambassador in London, Tzipi Hotovely, was summoned to the Foreign Office, a move generally reserved for the representatives of countries like Russia and Iran.\nTo make matters worse for Israel, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said a \"strong majority\" of the bloc's members favoured reviewing the 25-year-old Association Agreement with Israel.\nThe reasons for this flurry of diplomatic condemnation seemed clear enough.\nEvidence that Gaza was closer to mass starvation than at any time since the war began, following Hamas's attack in October 2023, was sending ripples of horror across the world.\nIsrael's military offensive, and the rhetoric surrounding it, suggested that conditions in the stricken territory were about to deteriorate once more.\nAddressing MPs on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy singled out the words of Israel's hardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who had spoken of \"cleansing\" Gaza, \"destroying what's left\" and relocating the civilian population to third countries.\n\"We must call this what it is,\" Lammy said. \"It's extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous. And I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\"\nSmotrich is not a decision-maker when it comes to conduct of the war in Gaza. Before now, his incendiary remarks might have been set to one side.\nBut those days appear to be over. Rightly or wrongly, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seen as in thrall to his far-right colleagues. Critics accuse him of relentlessly pursuing a war, without regard for the lives of Palestinian civilians or the remaining Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.\nCountries that have long supported Israel's right to defend itself are beginning to say \"enough is enough.\"\nThis week was clearly a significant moment for Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, a staunch defender of Israel (he once said \"I support Zionism without qualification\") who faced strong criticism from within the Labour Party for his reluctance last year to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nOn Tuesday, Sir Keir said the suffering of innocent children in Gaza was \"utterly intolerable\".\nIn the face of this unusually concerted action from some of his country's strongest allies, Netanyahu reacted furiously, suggesting Britain, France and Canada were guilty of supporting Hamas.\n\"When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice,\" he posted on X.\n\"You're on the wrong side of humanity and you're on the wrong side of history.\"\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar went further, suggesting there was a \"direct line\" between Israel's critics, including Starmer, and Wednesday night's killing of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, the two Israeli embassy employees gunned down outside the Jewish Museum in Washington.\nBut despite the outpourings of sympathy following the shooting, the Israeli government seems increasingly isolated, with western allies and prominent members of the Jewish diaspora all voicing anger \u2013 and anguish \u2013 over the war in Gaza.\nLord Levy, former Middle East envoy and advisor to Tony Blair, said he endorsed the current government's criticisms, even suggesting they might have come \"a little late\".\n\"There has to be a stand, not just from us in this country but internationally, against what is going on in Gaza,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One, describing himself as \"a very proud Jew\u2026who passionately cares for Israel\".\nBut silent, throughout all this, is the one man who could, if he wanted, stop the war.\nAt the end of his recent tour of the Gulf, Donald Trump said \"a lot of people are starving\".\nWhite House officials indicated the US president was frustrated with the war and wanted the Israeli government to \"wrap it up\".\nBut while other western leaders release expressions of outrage, Trump is saying almost nothing.",

        "headline": "As clock ticks down on Harry's security court appeal, why did his pleas fail?",
        "author": "Dominic Casciani",
        "body": "Three weeks after Prince Harry's dramatic court loss, any likelihood of him reviving the legal battle over his personal security arrangements is narrowing by the day.\nHis anger and hurt at how he feels his family's security was seemingly lessened, after he stepped back from working royal duties, has played out publicly - and earlier this month he lost his challenge at the Court of Appeal in London.\nIn a week's time, the deadline passes for Prince Harry - the Duke of Sussex - to try one last go, at the Supreme Court. But that seems unlikely after he told the BBC, in his exclusive interview after losing, he had no legal options left.\nAnd even if he were to ask for a hearing, the chances of him getting one appear slim because of what the courts have said so far.\nWhile the prince's complaint was about his treatment, ultimately the courts took no view on that. Instead, they ruled he had not understood how the body organising Royal Family protection worked - and how his decision to quit the UK, yet still have an \"in-and-out\" role in public life, was exceptional.\nOne former senior judge, who was not involved and spoke on background, felt the prince's case had been \"preposterous\" and \"hopeless\" from the start and anyone else bringing such a flawed claim would have been on the receiving end of more critical language from the courts.\nHowever, Prince Harry's argument was always wider - saying the state had to take into account the accident of his birth which made him a target.\n\"I was born into this position. I was born into those risks. And they've only increased over time,\" he said in the BBC interview.\nAt his first court hearing, in 2023, the prince said the UK was a place where he wanted his children \"to feel at home\" - but argued that can't happen \"if it's not possible to keep them safe\".\nAfter losing his appeal, he said he \"[couldn't] see a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the UK\".\nHarry's entire legal case centred on Ravec - which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office, and which Harry believes unfairly treated him.\nSo, to understand why he lost and seemingly has nowhere else to go, we first have to understand three key issues:\n- Why was Ravec created, and what is its specific role?\n- How did Ravec and the Home Office respond when Prince Harry quit as a front line royal?\n- Why did he think this was something the courts should solve?\nRavec evolved out of a 2003 Daily Mirror stunt when one of its reporters blagged his way into a job as a Buckingham Palace footman.\nIt led to panic in government - and a major review concluded royal security needed a jolt.\nSo Ravec was born - the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (its exact name has changed down the years).\nRavec oversees security for key public figures by assessing risks from terrorism, extremism, stalkers and any other foreseeable threat such as a \"fixated individual\".  Unsurprisingly, there is no public list of who gets protected.\nIt is responsible for VIP security within England, Wales and Scotland.\nThe committee is funded and overseen by the Home Office because its work is on behalf of the home secretary of the day.\nThe Royal Household has two members on the committee, including the monarch's private secretary. They contribute what they think is needed to protect people and key locations, such as Buckingham Palace.\nThe Metropolitan Police feeds information into the intelligence assessment and, ultimately provides the officers and kit to protect each \"principal\" - protected person.\nBut crucially, it's the Home Office-appointed chair who must decide how to spend the money and justify it to government.\nPart of Prince Harry's case was heard in private, behind closed court doors, to ensure Ravec's precise workings and its security plans remain confidential.\nWe learned Ravec's decisions typically draw on a report from the Risk Management Board (RMB), a Home Office panel pulling together all the facts about risks and actual threats.\nSo, in the example of the prince, it is well-known that al-Qaeda supporters and racist extremists are a concern for his family. We can therefore infer that the RMB has probably tried to work out what those threats really amount to.\nThat's the background. Let's turn to how it all became such a public row, leading from the High Court to the Court of Appeal.\nThe critical decisions were in spring 2020 when Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, \"stepped back\" from being working royals.\nTheir choice to move first to Canada, with their baby son, raised a question for Ravec: what kind of security should the prince's family now have, if they were no longer working royals and no longer living in the UK? What role should Ravec play in providing security, given its GB-only remit?\nCourt documents, while heavily redacted in places, show emails and letters were flying backwards and forwards between the Home Office, the Palace, Scotland Yard - and ultimately Prince Harry's team.\nRavec ruled out very early on allowing the Sussexes to pay the Met to deliver their security abroad. That, it said, was not what Ravec was for. Its task was to protect working royals in GB.\nThe government quickly formed the view that the couple would \"essentially become private citizens\" living abroad - and relations began to break down on 28 February 2020.\nRavec's then-chair, Sir Richard Mottram, told the late Queen's private secretary Sir Edward Young that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would lose their existing Met protection.\nSir Richard wrote: \"The future arrangements for [the duke and duchess] do not fit readily within this framework.\"\nIt was that simple: the Sussexes were moving overseas, outside of Ravec's duties.\nThe consequence was Prince Harry felt he was also being stripped of security when returning home - and there had been no formal Ravec meeting to decide his future protection.\nIn essence, he seemed to be arguing that the Royal Household's two members of the committee - which at the time included Sir Edward - may have influenced the Home Office's decision to reduce his security.\nIn his BBC interview, Harry asked \"What is the Royal Household's role [on Ravec]\u2026 if it isn't to influence and decide what they want for the members of their household?\"\nBut suspecting something is afoot is a world away from proving in court it really is.\nIn fact, the government successfully argued in court that Ravec had thought carefully and fairly about what to do.\nAfter the duke and duchess had quit the UK, the committee carried out some threat risk assessments and then committed to decide on the duke's security at home on a  case-by-case basis.\nIt meant he would, in principle, potentially get at least some Met Police protection if Ravec thought the circumstances of his visit home warranted it. While living abroad, however, the royal couple would have to fund their own security.\nRavec asked Prince Harry and his private security advisers for 28 days' notice of planned returns so it could work out what the state should provide.\nThis notice condition is one of the reasons why the prince says his security had been downgraded. Essentially, he feared he would get a fuller security detail if he were attending a grand royal occasion at home than if he were returning on his own private business.\nThe first test was when he flew in for the funeral of his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, in April 2021.\nPrince Harry was offered personal protective security - but outside of the Ravec system. The prince regarded this to be insufficient, in light of the risks he believed he faced.\nHis opinion was strengthened two months later when he said he had been dangerously hounded by paparazzi after a charity event.\nIn evidence, his security adviser noted the paparazzi's role in chasing Princess Diana to her death in a Paris tunnel.\nThe prince was convinced he had been treated unfairly and launched his Judicial Review of whether Ravec had acted unlawfully.\nTo win his case, Prince Harry had to land one of three legal arguments:\n- Ravec had acted unlawfully, beyond the powers it had\n- The committee had treated him unfairly in the way it had acted\n- Its decision was so irrational that nobody else sensible could possibly have reached the same conclusion\nThe prince's team did so by arguing  Ravec's policy had been overly rigid and inflexible. That failed - but there were other lines of attack:\n- The committee chairman had not followed Ravec's policies properly\n- The decision over the prince's future security had lacked transparency and consultation\n- No other decision-maker could have come up with the same bespoke plan he was offered\nYet, all of these complaints were rejected by judges.\nIn Judicial Reviews, it's not the role of judges to say what they would prefer to have happened. So, they never expressed a view whether Prince Harry deserved 20 or 250 more protection officers.\nMr Justice Lane, who legally demolished the prince's case a year ago in the High Court, said Ravec's chair and the Home Office officials who came up with the bespoke plan, had done so from \"positions of significant knowledge and expertise in the highly specialist area\".\n\"Courts should be wary of concluding that expert adjudicators have fundamentally misunderstood how to go about their allotted tasks,\" he said.\nThe prince's team, who argued his military service heightened the risks he faced, said that he had been treated unfairly compared with another Ravec-protected VIP whose life had changed.\nWe don't know who that was but it's common knowledge that former prime ministers can be protected long after they have left office. That's partly to ensure that decisions they take while in government - such as declaring war - are not affected by them worrying about their own personal future safety.\nThe prince appealed the judgement, going to the Court of Appeal. It ultimately ruled it was \"superficial\" to compare Prince Harry's circumstances with other VIPs.\nSo, was there something that the courts could not see - the whiff of an \"establishment stitch-up\" that meant the process was unfair?\nPrince Harry told the BBC: \"My representative on the Ravec committee, still to this day, is the Royal Household.  I am forced to go through the Royal Household and accept that they are putting my best interests forward.\"\nBut that complaint was a legal cul-de-sac because the High Court said the prince had no  evidence Ravec members had a \"closed mind\" or had been biased against him.\nWhat about his complaints about reckless paparazzi following his vehicle? Did he not have a case there? In a word, no. Ravec's job was to protect VIPs from people with \"hostile intent\", not photographers breaching his privacy.\nThe High Court ultimately described some of his submissions as having a \"distinct air of unreality\".  This is wording judges use when they have been really unimpressed with what they have heard - but don't want to sound rude.\nSir Geoffrey Vos, the senior judge who oversaw the later review in the Court of Appeal, put it differently and diplomatically.\nNobody could have been failed to be moved by Prince Harry's concerns, he said, but he needed to hear why the prince thought Ravec was breaking the law by giving him a bespoke security plan.\n\"I have tried to see how and whether the Claimant's sense of grievance translates into a legal argument,\" he explained.  But he couldn't find that legal argument. And so, Prince Harry lost.\nFive years of anguished legal battles came down to a difficult disagreement - but not one that the courts could find amounted to a \"stitch-up\".",

        "author": "Kelly Ng & Annabelle Liang",
        "body": "When Shreya Mishra Reddy was admitted to Harvard University in 2023, her parents were \"ecstatic\".\nIt is \"the ultimate school that anybody in India wants to get into,\" she tells the BBC.\nNow, with graduation around the corner, she has had to break the bad news to her family: she may not graduate in July from the executive leadership programme afterthe Trump administration moved to stop Harvard from enrolling international students\"as a result of their failure to adhere to the law\".\n\"It has been very difficult for my family to hear. They're still trying to process it,\" she said.\nMs Reddy is one of around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolments this year. They are a crucial source of revenue for the Ivy League school. About a third of its foreign students are from China, and more than 700 are Indian, such as Ms Reddy.\nAll of them are now unsure of what to expect next. Harvard has called the move \"unlawful\", which could lead to a legal challenge.\nBut that leaves the students' futures in limbo, be it those who are waiting to enrol this summer, or are halfway through college, or even those awaiting graduation whose work opportunities are tied to their student visas.\nThose who are already at Harvard would have to transfer to other American universities to remain in the US and retain their visas.\n\"I hope Harvard will stand for us and some solution can be worked out,\" Ms Reddy says.\nThe university has said it is \"fully committed to maintaining [its] ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably\".\nThe move against Harvard has huge implications for the million or so international students in the US. And it follows a growing crackdown by the Trump administration on institutes of higher learning, especially those that witnessed major pro-Palestinian protests on campus.\nDozens of them are facing investigations, as the government attempts to overhaul their accreditation process and reshape the way they are run.\nThe White Housefirst threatened to bar foreign students from Harvardin April, after the university refused to make changes to its hiring, admissions and teaching practices. And it also froze nearly $3bn in federal grants, which Harvard is challenging in court.\nStill, Thursday's announcement - which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said came because they were allegedly \"fostering violence\" and \"antisemitism\" - left students reeling.\nChinese student Kat Xie, who is in her second year in a STEM programme, says she is \"in shock\".\n\"I had almost forgotten about [the earlier threat of a ban] and then Thursday's announcement suddenly came.\"\nBut she adds a part of her had expected \"the worst\", so she had spent the last few weeks seeking professional advice on how to continue staying in the US.\nBut the options are \"all very troublesome and expensive\", she says.\nHarvard has been given 72 hours to comply with a list of demands to have an \"opportunity\" to regain its ability to enrol these students, including providing the government with all disciplinary records for non-immigrant students enrolled at Harvard over the past five years.\nNoem also demanded Harvard turn over electronic records, videos, or audio of \"illegal\" and \"dangerous or violent\" activity by non-immigrant students on campus.\nBut the Trump administration also appeared to single China out when Noem also accused Harvard of \"coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party\" in her statement.\nBeijing responded on Friday by criticising the \"politicisation\" of education.\nIt said the move would \"only harm the image and international standing of the United States\", urging for the ban to be withdrawn \"as soon as possible\".\n\"None of this is what we've signed up for,\" says 20-year-old Abdullah Shahid Sial from Pakistan, a very vocal student activist.\nA junior majoring in applied mathematics and economics, he was one of only two Pakistani undergraduate students admitted to Harvard in 2023.\nHe was also the first person in his family to study abroad. It was a \"massive\" moment for them, he says.\nThe situation he now finds himself in, he adds, is \"ridiculous and dehumanising\".\nBoth Ms Reddy and Mr Sial said foreign students apply to go to college in the US because they see it as a welcoming place where opportunities abound.\n\"You have so much to learn from different cultures, from people of different backgrounds. And everybody really valued that,\" Ms Reddy says, adding that this had been her experience at Harvard so far.\nBut Mr Sial says that has changed more recently and foreign students no longer feel welcome - the Trump administrationhas revoked hundreds of student visas and even detained students on campusesacross the country. Many of them were linked to pro-Palestinian protests.\nNow, Mr Sial adds, there is a lot of fear and uncertainty in the international student community.\nThat has only been exacerbated by the latest development. A postgraduate student from South Korea says she is having second thoughts about going home for the summer because she fears she won't be able to re-enter the US.\nShe did not want to reveal her name because she is worried that might affect her chances of staying in the US. She is one year away from graduating.\nShe said she had a gruelling semester and had been looking forward to \"reuniting with friends and family\" - until now.\nThe anxiety among foreign students is palpable, says Jiang Fangzhou, who is reading public administration in Harvard Kennedy School.\n\"We might have to leave immediately but people have their lives here - apartments, leases, classes and community. These are not things you can walk away from overnight.\"\nAnd the ban doesn't just affect current students, the 30-year-old New Zealander says.\n\"Think about the incoming ones, people who already turned down offers from other schools and planned their lives around Harvard. They're totally stuck now.\"\nAdditonal reporting by Mengchen Zhang",

        "body": "Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, regarded as one of the world's greatest documentary photographers, has died at the age of 81.\nThe Brazil-born photographer was known for his dramatic and unflinching black-and-white images of hardship, conflict and natural beauty, captured in 130 countries over 55 years.\nHis hard-hitting photos chronicled major global events such as the Rwanda genocide in 1994, burning oilfields at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, and the famine in the Sahel region of Africa in 1984.\n\"His lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, the power of transformative action,\" said a statement from Instituto Terra, the environmental organisation he founded with his wife, L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado.\nSome of his most striking pictures were taken in his home country, including epic photos of thousands of desperate figures working in open-cast gold mines and striking images of the indigenous people of the Amazon.\nBrazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva paid tribute, describing Salgado as \"one of the best... photographers the world has given us\".\nSalgado's final major project, Amaz\u00f4nia, spotlighted the rainforest's beauty and fragility.\nA lifelong advocate for the Amazon's indigenous people, Salgado documented the daily lives of a dozen of the tribes scattered throughout the rainforest - from hunting and fishing expeditions, to dances and rituals.\nHe spent seven years on an ambitious photographic journey, exploring the remote reaches of the Amazon rainforest and documenting its inhabitants.\nThe project culminated in an exhibition showcasing over 200 black-and-white images, offering a poignant glimpse into the region's landscapes and communities.\nThe Amaz\u00f4nia exhibition was displayed at the Science Museum in London and the the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester in 2021 and 2022.\n\"Sometimes I ask myself, \"Sebasti\u00e3o, was it really you that went to all these places?\"'he said to an interviewer last year.\n\"Was it really me that spent years travelling to 130 different countries, who went deep inside the forests, into oil fields and mines?\n\"Boy, it really is me who did this. I'm probably one of the photographers who's created the most work in the history of photography.\"\nBorn in 1944, Salgado left a career in economics to start as a photographer in 1973.\nHe worked on international assignments for a variety of photography agencies before forming his own, Amazonas Images, with L\u00e9lia in 1994.\nHe received the Sony World Photography Awards' Outstanding Contribution to Photography in 2024.\nOther accolades included the Prince of Asturias Award and recognition as a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador.\nThrough the Instituto Terra, Salgado and L\u00e9lia also restored his father's farm in Brazil to thriving rainforest by planting more than three million trees.\nThe institute's statement added: \"Sebasti\u00e3o was much more than one of the greatest photographers of our time.\n\"Alongside his life partner, L\u00e9lia Deluiz Wanick Salgado, he sowed hope where there was devastation and brought to life the belief that environmental restoration is also a profound act of love for humanity.\"",

        "body": "South Africa's latest crime statistics debunk claims that a genocide is being committed against white people, the country's police minister has said.\nThe widely discredited allegation was amplified by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, in an extraordinary meeting with his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa.\nTrump told Ramaphosa that white farmers in South Africa were being killed and \"persecuted\".\nOn Friday, South African Police Minister Senzo Mchunu said that between January and March, five out of the six people killed on farms were black and one was white.\nThe white victim lived on a farm, while the black people who were killed comprised two farm owners, two employees and one manager.\nMchunu said that in the previous quarter, from October to December 2024, 12 murders on farms were recorded. One of the 12 - a farm owner - was white.\nIt is the first time that South Africa's crime statistics have been broken down by race, but Mchunu said he had done so as a result of the recent genocide claims.\n\"The history of farm murders in the country has always been distorted and reported in an unbalanced way,\" he said.\nIn February, a South African judge dismissed the idea of a genocide as \"clearly imagined\" and \"not real\", when ruling in an inheritance case involving a wealthy benefactor's donation to a white supremacist group.\nClaims of genocide in South Africa have been circulating for years, catching the attention of right-wing groups in the US.\nRamaphosa visited the White House on Wednesday in an attempt to reset the countries' relations after Trump granted asylum to nearly 60 Afrikaners - descendants of mainly Dutch settlers who arrived in the 17th Century - saying they were \"victims of unjust racial discrimination\".\nDuring the meeting, which was broadcast live, Trump ambushed Ramaphosa with videos and images intended to support his claim of a white genocide.\nThe BBC found that this \"evidence\" contained numerous falsehoods.\n\"We have respect for the US as a country, we have respect for the people in that country and for President Trump, but we have no respect for the genocide story. It is totally unfounded and unsubstantiated,\" Mchunu said on Friday.\nA spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office also condemned Trump's comments.\n\"These are very serious issues. One should not use this word [genocide] casually without deep knowledge of what this means. Looking at the history of South Africa, it is wholly inappropriate,\" Ravina Shamdasani is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying.\nSouth Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world and Mchunu acknowledged that crime was a huge problem.\nHowever, he added that all sections of society were affected.\nThe minister also rejected allegations, repeated by Trump, that government was expropriating land held by white farmers.\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law which allowed the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. The South African government says no land has been seized yet under the act.\nThe law follows years of calls for land reform in South Africa, where the white minority possess the vast majority of privately held land and wealth in the country, more than 30 years since the racist system of apartheid ended.\nRelations between South Africa and the US have slumped since Trump took office in January. As well as offering asylum to Afrikaners, the US leader has cut aid to South Africa and expelled its ambassador.\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica",

        "headline": "Chaos spreads as desperate Gazans wait for food to arrive",
        "author": "Rushdi Abualouf",
        "body": "The limited amount of food that trickled into Gaza after an Israeli blockade was partly lifted has sparked chaotic scenes, as hunger continues to spread.\nBakeries distributing food were overwhelmed by crowds and forced to close on Thursday, and armed looters attacked an aid convoy overnight - sparking a firefight with Hamas security officials who, witnesses say, were then targeted by an Israeli drone strike.\nThe incident in central Gaza, recounted to BBC News by eyewitnesses, local journalists and Hamas officials, underscores the deteriorating security situation in Gaza, where governance has collapsed and lawlessness has spread.\nA convoy of 20 trucks, co-ordinated by the World Food Programme (WFP) and carrying flour, was en route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to a WFP warehouse in the city of Deir al-Balah.\nIt was being escorted by six Hamas security officers when it was ambushed by five unidentified gunmen, who fired at the tyres of the vehicles and tried to seize the cargo.\nThe Hamas security team engaged the attackers in a brief firefight, witnesses told BBC News.\nShortly after the clash began, Israeli drones targeted the Hamas unit with four missiles, killing six officers and wounding others.\nHamas issued a statement condemning the attack as \"a horrific massacre\" and accused Israel of deliberately targeting personnel tasked with protecting humanitarian aid.\nIn a statement, the IDF said one of its aircraft identified \"several gunmen, including Hamas terrorists\", near humanitarian aid trucks in central Gaza and \"struck the gunmen following the identification\".\nThe IDF said it would make \"all efforts possible to ensure that the humanitarian aid does not reach the hands of terrorist organizations\".\nA small amount of food has been allowed to cross into Gaza this week: around 130 lorries carrying aid have crossed the border in the last three days, after an 11-week blockade was partly lifted by the IDF.\nThe UN says 500 to 600 trucks of supplies a day are needed in Gaza.\nInternational agencies, including the UN and the WFP, have repeatedly warned that the growing insecurity is hampering the delivery of desperately needed food and medical supplies to the population - the majority of whom are displaced.\nIsrael says the blockade was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages still held in Gaza. Israel has also accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied.\nThe WFP said 15 of its aid trucks were looted overnight on Thursday, and that \"hunger, desperation and anxiety over whether more food aid is coming is contributing to rising insecurity\". The organisation called on Israel to help ensure the safe passage of supplies.\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, an agency that supports Palestinian refugees, wrote on X that no one should be \"surprised let alone shocked\" that aid had been looted because the \"people of Gaza have been starved [and] deprived of the basics including water and medicines for more than 11 weeks\".\nEarlier on Thursday, angry and hungry Palestinians crowded outside bakeries in Gaza in a desperate attempt to obtain bread, but the situation quickly descended into chaos, forcing distribution to halt.\nIt forced most bakeries to suspend operations, citing a lack of security.\nMany residents across Gaza voiced growing frustration over the aid distribution method and criticised the WFP, which oversees food deliveries.\nSome called for an immediate shift from distributing baked bread to handing out flour directly at a rate of one sack per family.\nLocals argue that distributing flour would allow families to bake at home or in tents - which, they say, would be safer than waiting at the overcrowded aid centres.\nPalestinians on the ground have told of the deepening humanitarian crisis and the collapse of basic services facing people living among the fighting or forced from their homes, as the IDF continues to ramp up its military operations against Hamas.\nFrom a displacement camp in southern Gaza's al-Mawasi, Abd al-Fatah Hussein told BBC News over WhatsApp that the situation is getting worse due to the number of people in the area.\nThe father-of-two said there is \"no room\" in al-Mawasi, where people ordered by the Israeli military to leave their homes are being told to go for safety.\n\"There is no electricity, no food, insufficient potable water, and no available medicine,\" he said.\n\"The repeated air strikes, especially during the night, add to the suffering.\"\nHe described the aid trucks coming in as a \"drop in the ocean of Gaza's needs\".\nWhen he announced some supplies would finally be allowed into the strip earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said only a \"basic amount\" would be able to cross.\nHumanitarian organisations have warned the amount of food entering Gaza in recent days is not close to what is needed to feed the 2.1 million people living there, while the UN has said about 500 lorries entered the territory on average every day before the war.\nWidespread famine, humanitarian groups have warned, looms over Gaza.\nSecretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said 400 trucks had been cleared to enter Gaza this week, but supplies from just 115 had been collected. He said nothing had \"reached the besieged north\" so far.\nWhile some flour, baby food and medical supplies had made it into Gaza, and some bakeries in the south had begun operating again, Guterres said that amounted to a \"teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required\".\n\"The supplies \u2013 160,000 pallets, enough to fill nearly 9,000 trucks \u2013 are waiting,\" he added.\nRida, a midwife with charity Project HOPE in Deir al-Balah, said women come to her clinic suffering from fainting, having sought medical help without eating breakfast.\nMany of them eat only one meal a day and subsist on high energy biscuits given by the charity, she said.\n\"Due to malnutrition they are always telling us, 'my baby cannot take enough supplement from my breast\u2026 my baby won't stop crying\u2026 they always need to be breastfed, but my breast is empty'.\"\nTeenager Saba Nahed Alnajjar lives in Khan Younis, where the IDF ordered a mass evacuation earlier this week ahead of what it said would be an unprecedented military operation there.\nShe said her family has stayed in their partially destroyed home.\n\"An evacuation order has been issued for our area, but we have not been displaced because we have nowhere else to go,\" she said.\n\"There are not many citizens in the area... The displaced are sleeping in the street and there is no food.\n\"The conditions are deteriorating and very difficult.\"\nSpeaking over WhatsApp messages - often the only way to speak to people in Gaza, which journalists are blocked from entering by the IDF - she said the \"bombing continues in a brutal manner\".\nShe and her family have little left, Saba said, adding: \"We have no food, no flour - no basic necessities of life.\"",

        "author": "Lily Jamali",
        "body": "Boeing is set to enter into a non-prosecution agreement in the fatal crashes of two 737 Max aircraft that killed hundreds, the US Department of Justice said.\nAs part of the deal, Boeing will avoid an upcoming fraud trial that could have resulted in the US aviation giant and defence contractor being labelled a felon. The deal includes the company admitting to obstructing federal aviation officials and paying $1.1 billion in fines.\nThe two crashes, in 2018 and 2019, left 346 people dead.\nThe government said it had conferred with families of crash victims, and said many either supported or did not oppose the deal. Some families, however, have expressedoutrageat the prospect of such a deal.\nBoeing told the BBC on Friday evening that it had no comment. The US Department of Justice would not comment.\nIn a court filing on Friday, the Justice Department said Boeing would admit to \"conspiracy to obstruct and impede\" an investigation by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and to pay more than $1.1 billion in fines.\nBoeing will also have to continue making improvements to its anti-fraud compliance and ethics program.\nBoeing's 737 Max models were grounded globally for almost two years after the  2019 crash of a Ethiopian Airlines flight outside of Addis Ababa. All 157 people on-board were killed.\nFive months before that, a 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia. 189 people aboard were killed.\nBoth crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems.\nThe crashes led to fraud charges against a former top Boeing pilot who was acquitted in 2022.\nIn 2021, in the closing days of the first Trump presidency, Boeing reached a settlement with prosecutors that protected it from prosecution for three years.\nFederal prosecutors said Boeing violated that deal by failing to create and follow a compliance and ethics program aimed at detecting violations of US laws.\nA door panel flew off a 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines two days before the agreement had been set to expire.\nLast year, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal fraud in a settlement to avoid trials, but the agreement was rejected by a federal judge who cited concerns that race-based considerations under Biden -era DEI policies would be used in selecting an independent monitor in charge of overseeing Boeing's compliance.\nThe Justice Department is expected to file a motion to dismiss the case by late next week once the agreement is finalized.\n\"The Agreement guarantees further accountability and substantial benefits from Boeing immediately, while avoiding the uncertainty and litigation risk presented by proceeding to trial,\" the Justice Department stated in court papers.\nMany victims' families have long pushed for a public trial and prosecution of former Boeing officials, and they have opposed attempts to drop the criminal case.\n\"It's a sweetheart deal,\" says Robert Clifford, a lawyer representing relatives of crash victims.\nCatherine Berthet, of France, whose 28-year-old daughter died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash said she was \"absolutely stunned\" by the DOJ's decision to grant Boeing a non-prosecution agreement.\n\"[T]he government has blind faith in Boeing, to the point of letting it get away with the murder of 346 people, including my so beloved daughter Camille,\" said Berthet.",

        "author": "James Waterhouse & Amy Walker",
        "body": "Russia and Ukraine have each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022.\nThey both returned 270 servicemen and 120 civilians on the Ukrainian border with Belarus, as part of the only deal agreed in direct talks in Istanbul a week ago.\nBoth sides had agreed to an exchange of 1,000 prisoners and confirmed there would be further swaps in the coming days.\nAlthough there have been dozens of smaller-scale exchanges, no other handover has involved as many civilians.\nThe Russian defence ministry said servicemen and civilians, including those captured by Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk border region during Kyiv's offensive in recent months, were among those handed over.\nThey were currently on Belarusian territory and were to be taken to Russia for medical checks and treatment, the ministry said.\n\"We are bringing our people home,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on social media.\n\"We are verifying every surname, every detail about each person.\"\nUkraine's co-ordination headquarters for prisoners of war said the 270 Ukrainian servicemen had fought in regions across the east and north, from Kyiv,  Chernihiv and Sumy to Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kherson.\nThree of the 390 released on Friday were women, officials said, and some of the soldiers had been held since 2022.\nUS President Donald Trump earlier posted his congratulations on his Truth Social platform, claiming that the swap was complete and that \"this could lead to something big???\".\nFamilies of Ukrainian soldiers held by Russia gathered in northern Ukraine on Friday in the hope that their sons and husbands would be among those released.\nNatalia, whose son Yelizar was captured during the battle for the city of Severodonetsk three years ago, told the BBC she believed he would return, but did not know when.\nOlha said that since her son Valerii had been captured with five other soldiers in the east, her life had stopped, as she did not know if they were still alive.\n\"They were captured two months ago in Luhansk. They went missing in a village.\"\nThe prisoner swap was agreed in Turkey a week ago, when low-level delegations from Ukraine and Russia came face to face for the first time since March 2022, even though the meeting lasted only two hours and failed to make any progress towards a ceasefire.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that there would be a second round of talks, when Moscow would hand a \"memorandum\" to the Ukrainian side.\nTrump said earlier this week that Russia and Ukraine would \"immediately\" start negotiating towards a ceasefire and an end to the war, after a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nSince then, Zelensky hasaccused Putin of \"trying to buy time\"to continue the war.\nItaly's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hasbacked a suggestion from Trumpthat the Vatican might mediate talks on negotiating a ceasefire, but Lavrov said that was \"not a very realistic option\".\nThe Russian foreign minister repeated an unfounded claim that Zelensky was not a legitimate leader and suggested new elections should be held before a potential future peace agreement is signed.\nAsked if Russia was ready to sign a deal, Lavrov said: \"First we need to have a deal. And when it's agreed, then we will decide. But, as President Putin has said many times, President Zelensky does not have legitimacy.\"\nHe said after an agreement was ready, Russia would \"see who out of those in power in Ukraine has legitimacy\".\n\"The key task now is to prepare a peace agreement which will be reliable and provide a long-term, stable and fair peace without creating security threats for anyone. In our case, we're concerned with Russia.\"",

        "author": "Flora Drury",
        "body": "A \"really muscly\" kangaroo \"tried to drown\" a man in Australia, after the two got into a punch-up.\nDon James is said to have found himself fighting for his life as the marsupial held him down in floodwaters which had pooled on the side of the road near Port Macquarie - only escaping after the animal appeared to become spooked.\nKristy Lees, who watched the battle unfold in her rear-view mirror, told the BBC: \"It's not every day a big, male kangaroo decides to take you on... Even in Australia, you do not expect to see it.\"\nShe suspects the \"very distressed\" kangaroo had become trapped in the area following the record flooding that hit New South Wales this week, leaving five people dead.\nMs Lees was first alerted to the kangaroo's presence as she drove down to check the water levels in Port Macquarie's North Shore with her husband, at about 09:00 local time on Friday (23:00 GMT on Thursday).\nTwo men - one of whom was later identified asDon James by Australian news network ABC- warned them that there was a \"really big\" kangaroo just around the next parked car.\nAnd sure enough, there was the kangaroo - \"as big as the car\" it was standing next to.\nThe next thing Ms Lees knew, the kangaroo had launched towards her car, which she had slowed to a crawl so as not to startle the animal, and started to attack it.\nBut as he moved round to her side of the car, the kangaroo appeared to spot another target: Mr James, who was still walking away up the road.\nThe kangaroo gave chase.\n\"They literally got into a boxing match,\" Kristy said. \"I'm looking in the rear-view mirror and they are throwing punches.\"\nMr James then ran backwards before tripping and falling into a patch of floodwater by the side of the road.\nThe next thing Kristy knew, the \"kangaroo was holding him down\".\n\"The kangaroo tried to drown the man,\" she said. \"I realised what was happening and told my husband [who couldn't see the fight from his seat] to get out the car and help.\"\nBut then the kangaroo appears to have been spooked - perhaps by the approaching car driven by Mr James's friend - allowing him to escape down towards Ms Lees, who has since tried to warn as many neighbours as possible.\n\"The kangaroo was trying to drown me,\" he told Ms Lees, who was able to say she had seen it all.\n\"I just remember being under water and kicking and screaming and carrying on,\" Mr James later told ABC.\nIt was, he said, \"pretty traumatic for a while there\".\nKangaroos have been known to appear to attempt to drown their foes - although these are usually animals the size of dogs.\nKangaroo ecologist Graeme Coulson, from the University of Melbourne, revealed to ABC that his neighbour had lost two dogs that way.\n\"There's a very strong instinct - kangaroos will go to water if they're threatened by a predator,\" he told the news network.\nHowever, he said, the behaviour is likely more about protecting themselves than drowning their foe.\nThat is unlikely to make Mr James feel any better about Friday morning's altercation - especially as he told Ms Lees that just 12 months ago he had fended off another attack, that time by a great white shark.\n\"I feel like they're trying to kill me, all these animals,\" he reportedly said.\nThe BBC has attempted to contact Mr James for comment.",

        "author": "Paul Glynn",
        "body": "Kneecap fans turned out in force on Friday to support the Irish-language hip-hop trio at their biggest ever festival headline gig, which came just days after a band member was charged with a terror offence.\nLiam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh wascharged by the Metropolitan Policefor having allegedly displayed a flag in support of proscribed Lebanese organisation Hezbollah at a gig last year.\nThe band denied the offence, calling it \"political policing\" and \"a carnival of distraction\" away from Gaza.\nSpeaking on stage at London's Wide Awake, the rapper - due to appear in court next month - said the authorites were \"trying to silence us\" before Glastonbury and urged fans not to be \"on the wrong side of history.\"\n\"I know we're out, we're enjoying ourselves and we're trying to listen to some tunes at a festival... believe me lads, I wish I didn't have to do this,\" he said at the south London event.\n\"But the world's not listening. The world needs to see solidarity of 20,000 people in a park in London chanting, 'free free Palestine!'\"\nThe chant echoed out around Brixton's Brockwell Park.\nThe UN said on Friday thatGaza was in the \"cruellest phase\" of war,with 9,000 trucks' worth of aid ready at the border for the Palestinian territory.\n\"Let's remember how lucky we are to be in a field with our friends and not being bombed from the sky,\" Kneecap's frontman, who goes by the stage name Mo Chara, told the audience on Friday night.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the Palestinian group Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 53,762 people, including 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nFriday's concert - Kneecap's first big gig since the investigation was launched - followed a smaller \"secret\"set at London's 100 clubthe night before.\nIt saw the band - comprised of Chara, M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in) and balaclava-wearing beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh) - rip through tracks from their acclaimed album Fine Art, which has seen a surge in streaming in recent weeks since the controversy began.\nThis included a brand new track called The Recap which dropped online only hours earlier, and begins with a clip of a news report about the counter-terrorism investigation.\nFans, many of whom were wearing Irish and Palestinian flags and shirts, bounced and sang along to their tracks which find the west Belfast act rapping in English and Irish about everything from drug-fuelled parties to Northern Ireland and Gaza.\nOne such fan, Myrtle from Brighton, told BBC News she agreed with the band's views on Gaza.\n\"I think it's amazing. I think they're completely right,\" she said.\n\"Imagine in a few years if we get to a state where it's [even worse] and you can't say that you've been on the right side of history and you've not made an effort to make that change, how do you not feel guilty?\"\nShe added: \"Obviously it's led to one of them being charged with a terror offence which is awful, but it's brought more attention to the politics behind it.\"\nThe gig culminated in rousing renditions of Kneecap songs Get Your Brits out and H.O.O.D, with the band encouraging fans to bellow out the Irish Republican slogan \"Tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1\", which translates as \"our day will come\".\nBrixton resident John told us outside the gig: \"At best they're naive, at worst they're apologists for violence.\"\n\"Do they really know what Ireland was like before theGood Friday Agreement?\" he asked.\nAnother fan who lives in Orkney, Gwen, told us she had first come across Kneecap \"by accident\" when her sister told her about the band's nowBafta-winning film.\nShe lived in a kibbutz in Israel when she was younger. \"I've spent a lot of time in Israel, and I've had a lovely experience with Israeli people, and I've met Palestinian people in Israel,\" she explained.\n\"And the main thing that resonated with me when I was in Israel was that most people on the ground just kind of want peace. They don't like living with the constant fear of terror.\"\nShe said she \"loved Kneecap even more\" when they \"started putting their light on Gaza\".\nSpeaking at the Ivor Novello awards a day earlier, the composer of Kneecap's semi-autobiographical biopic, Michael \"Mikey J\" Asante, told the BBC's Mark Savage: \"I haven't really spoken to them, it's all pretty new - but more than anything else there's the notion of freedom of expression.\n\"It will all work out how it needs to. So you leave the people who have the information to make the right decisions.\"\n\u00d3 hAnnaidh seemed unconcerned about the law on the night, joking with fans that they would have to write to him in jail while asking them to get their \"grannies to light a wee candle for me\".\nTo their many fans, Kneecap are relatable, hedonistic provocateurs, mixing rapid-fire anti-establishment lyrics that aim to give a voice to the oppressed with danceable bass-heavy beats.\nTo their critics they are dangerous upstarts who have now gone too far.\nDuring an incendiaryperformance at the Coachella music festival in California last month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they have been called antisemitic and \"terrorist sympathisers\".\nThen in the UK, historic footage from two of their gigs wasassessed by counter-terrorism police. One appeared to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\" - both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them -  while another video allegedly showed them calling for Conservative MPs to be killed.\nKneecap apologised to the families of murdered MPsSir David Amess and Jo Cox but claimed footage of the incident had been taken out of context and \"exploited and weaponised\", adding they had have \"never supported\" Hamas or Hezbollah.\nThey repeated the claim they were \"being made an example of\" on stage on Friday.\nOrganisers of Friday's Brixton event confirmed in a statement earlier this month that the gig would go ahead after they had held \"positive discussions with key stakeholders\".\n\"Wide Awake Festival has a proud history of supporting the alternative music scene and we look forward to staging another unforgettable event showcasing the very best emerging and established talent,\" they said.\nBut other Kneecap gigs have been cancelled in the wake of the controversy, including their sets at the Eden Project in Cornwall and Plymouth Pavilions.\nPolice Scotland have saidthat allowing them to perform at the TRNSMT music festival in Glasgow next month will require \"a significant policing operation\".\nSome politicians including Tory leader Kemi Badenoch have called for Kneecap to be banned and Commons Leader Lucy Powell has said the group should not be allowed to perform at Glastonbury next month, where they are listed for the Saturday.\nLiam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh is due to appear in court a week before the festival begins.\nArtists including CMAT, Massive Attack and Primal Scream as well as Paul Weller and DJ Annie Mac have all publicly defended Kneecap, saying the powers-that-be are \"strategically concocting moral outrage over the stage utterings of a young punk band\" while ignoring the situation in Gaza.",

        "headline": "Chaos spreads as desperate Gazans wait for food to arrive",
        "author": "Rushdi Abualouf",
        "body": "The limited amount of food that trickled into Gaza after an Israeli blockade was partly lifted has sparked chaotic scenes, as hunger continues to spread.\nBakeries distributing food were overwhelmed by crowds and forced to close on Thursday, and armed looters attacked an aid convoy overnight - sparking a firefight with Hamas security officials who, witnesses say, were then targeted by an Israeli drone strike.\nThe incident in central Gaza, recounted to BBC News by eyewitnesses, local journalists and Hamas officials, underscores the deteriorating security situation in Gaza, where governance has collapsed and lawlessness has spread.\nA convoy of 20 trucks, co-ordinated by the World Food Programme (WFP) and carrying flour, was en route from the Kerem Shalom crossing to a WFP warehouse in the city of Deir al-Balah.\nIt was being escorted by six Hamas security officers when it was ambushed by five unidentified gunmen, who fired at the tyres of the vehicles and tried to seize the cargo.\nThe Hamas security team engaged the attackers in a brief firefight, witnesses told BBC News.\nShortly after the clash began, Israeli drones targeted the Hamas unit with four missiles, killing six officers and wounding others.\nHamas issued a statement condemning the attack as \"a horrific massacre\" and accused Israel of deliberately targeting personnel tasked with protecting humanitarian aid.\nIn a statement, the IDF said one of its aircraft identified \"several gunmen, including Hamas terrorists\", near humanitarian aid trucks in central Gaza and \"struck the gunmen following the identification\".\nThe IDF said it would make \"all efforts possible to ensure that the humanitarian aid does not reach the hands of terrorist organizations\".\nA small amount of food has been allowed to cross into Gaza this week: around 130 lorries carrying aid have crossed the border in the last three days, after an 11-week blockade was partly lifted by the IDF.\nThe UN says 500 to 600 trucks of supplies a day are needed in Gaza.\nInternational agencies, including the UN and the WFP, have repeatedly warned that the growing insecurity is hampering the delivery of desperately needed food and medical supplies to the population - the majority of whom are displaced.\nIsrael says the blockade was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages still held in Gaza. Israel has also accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied.\nThe WFP said 15 of its aid trucks were looted overnight on Thursday, and that \"hunger, desperation and anxiety over whether more food aid is coming is contributing to rising insecurity\". The organisation called on Israel to help ensure the safe passage of supplies.\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, an agency that supports Palestinian refugees, wrote on X that no one should be \"surprised let alone shocked\" that aid had been looted because the \"people of Gaza have been starved [and] deprived of the basics including water and medicines for more than 11 weeks\".\nEarlier on Thursday, angry and hungry Palestinians crowded outside bakeries in Gaza in a desperate attempt to obtain bread, but the situation quickly descended into chaos, forcing distribution to halt.\nIt forced most bakeries to suspend operations, citing a lack of security.\nMany residents across Gaza voiced growing frustration over the aid distribution method and criticised the WFP, which oversees food deliveries.\nSome called for an immediate shift from distributing baked bread to handing out flour directly at a rate of one sack per family.\nLocals argue that distributing flour would allow families to bake at home or in tents - which, they say, would be safer than waiting at the overcrowded aid centres.\nPalestinians on the ground have told of the deepening humanitarian crisis and the collapse of basic services facing people living among the fighting or forced from their homes, as the IDF continues to ramp up its military operations against Hamas.\nFrom a displacement camp in southern Gaza's al-Mawasi, Abd al-Fatah Hussein told BBC News over WhatsApp that the situation is getting worse due to the number of people in the area.\nThe father-of-two said there is \"no room\" in al-Mawasi, where people ordered by the Israeli military to leave their homes are being told to go for safety.\n\"There is no electricity, no food, insufficient potable water, and no available medicine,\" he said.\n\"The repeated air strikes, especially during the night, add to the suffering.\"\nHe described the aid trucks coming in as a \"drop in the ocean of Gaza's needs\".\nWhen he announced some supplies would finally be allowed into the strip earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said only a \"basic amount\" would be able to cross.\nHumanitarian organisations have warned the amount of food entering Gaza in recent days is not close to what is needed to feed the 2.1 million people living there, while the UN has said about 500 lorries entered the territory on average every day before the war.\nWidespread famine, humanitarian groups have warned, looms over Gaza.\nSecretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said 400 trucks had been cleared to enter Gaza this week, but supplies from just 115 had been collected. He said nothing had \"reached the besieged north\" so far.\nWhile some flour, baby food and medical supplies had made it into Gaza, and some bakeries in the south had begun operating again, Guterres said that amounted to a \"teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required\".\n\"The supplies \u2013 160,000 pallets, enough to fill nearly 9,000 trucks \u2013 are waiting,\" he added.\nRida, a midwife with charity Project HOPE in Deir al-Balah, said women come to her clinic suffering from fainting, having sought medical help without eating breakfast.\nMany of them eat only one meal a day and subsist on high energy biscuits given by the charity, she said.\n\"Due to malnutrition they are always telling us, 'my baby cannot take enough supplement from my breast\u2026 my baby won't stop crying\u2026 they always need to be breastfed, but my breast is empty'.\"\nTeenager Saba Nahed Alnajjar lives in Khan Younis, where the IDF ordered a mass evacuation earlier this week ahead of what it said would be an unprecedented military operation there.\nShe said her family has stayed in their partially destroyed home.\n\"An evacuation order has been issued for our area, but we have not been displaced because we have nowhere else to go,\" she said.\n\"There are not many citizens in the area... The displaced are sleeping in the street and there is no food.\n\"The conditions are deteriorating and very difficult.\"\nSpeaking over WhatsApp messages - often the only way to speak to people in Gaza, which journalists are blocked from entering by the IDF - she said the \"bombing continues in a brutal manner\".\nShe and her family have little left, Saba said, adding: \"We have no food, no flour - no basic necessities of life.\"",

        "headline": "Tensions rise as superpowers scrap for a piece of the Arctic",
        "author": "Katya Adler",
        "body": "As soon as Magnus M\u00e6land became mayor of a small town on Norway's northern tip in late 2023, three delegations from China came knocking on his door.\n\"It's because they want to be a polar superpower,\" he tells me.\nChina might not instinctively spring to mind when you think about the Arctic - but it's determined to be a big Arctic player. It's been vying to buy real estate, get involved in infrastructure projects and hopes to establish a permanent regional presence.\nChina already describes itself as a \"near-Arctic state\", even though its northernmost regional capital Harbin is on roughly the same latitude as Venice, Italy.\nBut the Arctic is fast becoming one of the most hotly-contested parts of the world. Beijing faces stiff competition from Russia, Europe, India and the US.\nThe race for the Arctic is on.\nClimate scientists say the Arctic is warming four times faster than anywhere else. This impacts ecosystems, wildlife and local populations. The Arctic is enormous, encompassing 4% of the globe.\nBut global powers see a new world of opportunities opening up in the Arctic on the back of environmental changes.\nThe melting ice in the Arctic makes it easier to access the region's incredible natural resources - critical minerals, oil, and gas - around 30% of untapped natural gas is said to be found in the Arctic.\nAnd it's opening up possibilities for new maritime trade routes, drastically reducing travel time between Asia and Europe. In the export business, time is money. China has been developing a \"Polar Silk Road\" plan for Arctic shipping.\nWhen I visit, the port of Kirkenes looks pretty ghostly.\nInside the Arctic Circle, at the northernmost point of mainland Norway, the former mining town is a gritty contrast with the picture-postcard, snow-covered mountains and fjords that surround it.\nThere are shuttered shops and abandoned warehouses, riddled with broken windows. The town feels forgotten and left behind.\nSo you can imagine the appeal of possibly becoming the first European port of call for masses of container ships from Asia, depending on how fast the polar ice continues to melt.\nThe town's port director, Terje J\u00f8rgensen, plans to build a brand new international port. His eyes light up when he talks about becoming the Singapore of Europe's High North.\n\"What we're trying to build here in Kirkenes is a trans-shipment port where three continents meet: North America, Europe and Asia. We'll take the goods ashore and reload onto other vessels [for further export]. We don't need to sell any land to anyone. Not to a UK company, not a Chinese company.\nNew laws in Norway prohibit the transfer of property or businesses, if the sale could harm \"Norwegian security interests\", he says. What they're waiting for, he adds, are clear guidelines from the government about what kind of critical infrastructure this might cover.\nMayor M\u00e6land certainly seems wary of China's intentions. \"We want a relationship with China, but we don't want to be dependent on China,\" he tells me.\n\"Europe has to ask itself 'How dependent do you want to be on totalitarian and authoritarian regimes?'\"\nChina's purchase-your-way-into-the-Arctic approach is beginning to be rejected across the European Arctic. Recent attempts by Beijing to buy into seaports in Norway and Sweden and an airport in Greenland, for example, were rebuffed.\nThis is pushing polar-hungry China - the biggest emerging superpower in the world - into the arms of the Arctic's largest player, Russia.\nRussia controls a whopping half of the Arctic shoreline - and it's been hoovering up Chinese investments.\nThe two countries cooperate militarily in the Arctic too. China's coastguard entered the Arctic for the first time in October, in a joint patrol with Russian forces. The two countries had staged joint military exercises here the month earlier. In July, long-range bombers from both countries provocatively patrolled the Arctic Ocean near Alaska in the United States.\nIt's as if Beijing and Moscow are looking over at Nato, which has stepped up its exercises in the Arctic, and are saying: We can do this too.\nEvery country bordering the Arctic is a member of Nato except Russia. Finland and Sweden joined after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nAndreas \u00d8sthagen, a senior fellow at the independent Fridtjof Nansen Institute, describes the Arctic as \"low-hanging fruit\" for Russian-Chinese collaboration.\n\"Russia needs investments and commercial actors who are interested in developing the Arctic - LNG [liquefied natural gas] resources, oil resources, or developing a northern sea route as a shipping lane.\n\"China is that market. The two countries are looking for ways to expand their political, economic, even military cooperation.\"\nBut China is keen not to align itself too closely with Russia. It wants to avoid Western sanctions and to continue doing business with Western powers, inside and outside the Arctic.\nRussia has reservations too.\n\"Be careful not to overrate the Russia-China relationship,\" says Mr \u00d8sthagen. \"Russia remains wary of letting China too deep into its Arctic.\"\nMoscow relies heavily on its natural resources there. And it's courting other Arctic investors too, including the US, according to reports.\nRussia also relies on its Arctic to store strategic weapons - mainly on its Kola peninsula, which bristles with nuclear capabilities and is home to its legendary Northern Fleet.\nBack in Norway, Kirkenes residents live under that shadow of the Russian Bear next door. They always have. The border with Russia is a 10 minutes drive away by car. And Kola peninsula feels uncomfortably close.\nIn Cold War times, the town became known as a nest of spies - a frontline between the West and the Soviet Union.\nNorway believes Russia is using its Arctic to train new recruits to fight, and to fly bombers from, to attack Ukraine.\nThough not directly at war with Russia, Norway, and specifically the north of the country along its roughly 200km long land border, feels under attack.\n\"We see it here locally,\" says Col J\u00f8rn Kviller, speaking to me by the clear waters of the Pasvik River that separates Norway and Russia. Just in front of us are Norway's bright yellow, and Russia's red and green, border posts.\nSince the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there have been increasingly frequent incidents of GPS jamming that have even caused commercial pilots to change navigation systems. Cases of espionage by the border - \"everything from signals intelligence to agents being sent to Norway\" - have shot up, Col Kviller tells me.\nNorway and its Nato allies are also on the alert for Russian spy submarines and other vessels in the Arctic.\nI'm able to see how Norway monitors this threat, after we get high security clearance to enter the country's Cold War-era joint military command. It's deep inside a quartz mountain in Bod\u00f8, within the Arctic Circle.\nWe find a labyrinth of tunnels and surveillance rooms where Norway gathers real-time intelligence from land, air and sea, focused on suspicious-looking vessels in and near its Arctic waters. Everything is shared in real-time with Nato allies.\nCrucially, any Russian vessel wanting to enter Europe has to pass through Norwegian waters first.\nAgents in the mountain HQ are on the lookout for signs of espionage and sabotage around what officials call underwater \"critical infrastructure\" as part of the Kremlin's hybrid warfare against the West.\nTargets include undersea communications cables - connecting continents and permitting trillions of dollars' worth of financial transactions a day - and also oil and gas pipelines.\nNorway is a major supplier of natural gas to Europe, including the UK, especially since sanctions were imposed on Russian exports following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nMoscow has been modernising its military capabilities in the Arctic. It has a serious fleet of spy and nuclear submarines. If they pass undetected, they could potentially target missiles at capitals across Europe and also threaten the US.\nUS President Donald Trump has told Europe it must do more for its own defence, but inside the Arctic, there is a \"great overlap of interests\", says the chief of the Norwegian joint headquarters Vice Adm Rune Andersen.\n\"This is also about US homeland defence\u2026 The Russian concentration of nuclear weapons, the capabilities that Russia is deploying are not only aimed at Europe, but also at the US,\" he says.\nVice Adm Andersen doesn't believe any party is courting open conflict in the Arctic but with global tensions rising elsewhere, such as over Ukraine, the potential for spillover in the Arctic is there.\nThe vice admiral's team schedules a routine call to Russia's Northern Fleet every Wednesday afternoon -to keep communication channels open, they say. Just in case.\nIf you leave Kirkenes and head towards the North Pole, you come across the magnificent Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard at about the half-way mark. It's home to ice floes, glaciers and more polar bears than people.\nSvalbard is at the heart of the scramble between global powers for Arctic resources. While Norwegian, the archipelago is governed by a treaty allowing people from all countries that signed it to work there visa-free. Most are employed in mines, tourism and scientific research.\nThat may sound harmonious, but since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there's been a noticeable flexing of nationalist muscles in some communities here.\nThey include military parades by the Russian settlement to mark their commemorations for the end of World War Two, the flying of a Soviet flag over Russian infrastructure, and growing suspicion that the Chinese have made their Svalbard research station dual-purpose - for military espionage.\nRegardless of whether or not that's true, local mayor Terje Aunevik says it would be na\u00efve to suggest there was no intelligence-gathering going on in the different countries' research centres.\n\"Of course there is... I think the world has been gripped by Arctic fomo [fear of missing out].\"\nThe day I arrive in Svalbard, it's Norway's national day. The streets are thronging with a snaking parade of mums, dads and children from the local school, clad in Norwegian national dress.\nLongyearbyen is the northernmost town in the world. Bright sunshine glints off the Arctic waters below the main street, and the flat-topped, snow and ice-covered mountains all around.\nEverywhere I look, I see shop windows, prams and women's hairdos festooned with blue, white and red Norwegian flags. Perhaps I imagined it, but among all the cheeriness, it felt like there was another, unspoken sentiment that day, a reminder: 'Svalbard belongs to us!'\nThe rising mood of national rivalries in the Arctic is not without consequences.\nIndigenous communities in the region, just over half of whom live in the Russian Arctic, often feel that there is a failure on the part of those in power to acknowledge the rights of the peoples who have long called the region home.\nMiyuki Daorana, a youth activist from Greenland representing the Inughuit indigenous community, says when Donald Trump claimed he wanted to buy the country during his first presidency, they laughed it off. But this time it feels different, she says.\n\"Because of the current global political situation, with power play and competition for resources, it's much more serious.\"\nShe, and others in the indigenous communities, accuse European countries of using the \"climate crisis\" as an excuse to \"extract and invade indigenous lands\".\n\"It's something we call green colonialism or developmental aggression where they really want to just take more and more from lands,\" she says.\n\"[The Arctic] is not just a topic for us. It's not just an interest, it's not a study. It's literally our lives and real struggles and emotions and very unfair injustices.\n\"The government and the politicians, they're supposed to work for the people. But I haven't seen that. It's mostly diplomatic words.\"\nNot long ago, you used to hear talk of Arctic exceptionalism, where the eight countries bordering the Arctic - Canada, Russia, the US, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland - along with representatives of six Arctic indigenous communities and other observer countries, including China and the UK, would put aside political differences to work together to protect and govern this incredible part of the world.\nBut these are times now of big power politics. Countries increasingly act in their own interests.\nWith so many rival nations now in the Arctic, the risks of misinterpretation or miscalculation are high.",

        "author": "Jaroslav Lukiv",
        "body": "The European Union's trade chief said the 27-member bloc is committed to securing a trade deal with the US based on \"respect\" not \"threats\".\nIt comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the US from the EU.\n\"The EU's fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,\" EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said after a call with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\"EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.\"\nEarlier on Friday, Trump expressed impatience with the pace of ongoing EU-US trade negotiations, saying his plan to raise tariffs on 1 June was set.\nWriting on social media, Trump said: \"Our discussions with [the EU] are going nowhere,\" adding that there would be no tariffs for products built or manufactured in the US.\n\"I'm not looking for a deal - we've set the deal,\" he told reporters later, before immediately adding that a big investment in the US by a European company might make him open to a delay.\nThe EU is one of the Washington's largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (\u20ac528bn; \u00a3443bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show.\nReacting to Trump's threats, European governments warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides.\n\"We do not need to go down this road,\" said Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin. \"Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward.\"\nFrance's Foreign Minister Laurent Saint-Martin, said: \"We are maintaining the same line: de-escalation, but we are ready to respond.\"\nGerman Economy Minister Katherina Reiche said the bloc \"must do everything\" to reach a solution with the US.\nWhile Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told reporters that he backed the EU's strategy in trade talks and \"we have seen before that tariffs can go up and down in talks with the US\".\nThe EU is negotiating with the US as a bloc, though Stephen Moore, a former economic advisor to Trumpwho works for conservativethink tank the Heritage Foundation, told the BBC: \"What may happen in Europe... is that we may try to negotiate individually with countries in Europe.\"\nHe added that in his opinion Trump's \"ultimate aim is really to decouple not just the US but the whole world from Chinese influence which would be a very good thing if he could pull that off\".\nIn early April, Trump announced tariffs against a long list of countries, including a 20% tax on most EU goods being sold into the US.\nSoon afterwards, the president paused the higher tariffs for three months, until 8 July, to allow for more negotiations, but kept a 10% baseline tax in place against the US's trade partners.\nHigher US tariffs also remained in place against China though they were substantially lowered.\nDespite the climbdown from Trump, the US kept a 25% tariff against EU steel and aluminium imports in place.\nThe EU has threatened \u2013 and paused \u2013 its own measures against the US. It said it would introduce a 25% tariff on \u20ac18bn ($20bn; \u00a315bn) worth of US goods coming into Europe but this has been put on hold.\nIt is also currently consulting on additional measures against US imports into the US valued at \u20ac95bn.\nTrump's complaints about Europe have focused on what he claims is an uneven trade relationship - the EU sells more goods to the US than it buys from America.\nTrump blames a trade deficit on policies that he claims are unfair to American companies, and he has specifically raised concerns about policies related to cars and agricultural products.\nTrump also warned Apple that he would impose a 25% import tax \"at least\" on iPhones not manufactured in America, later widening the threat to any smartphone.\nShares in the US and EU fell on Friday after the latest threats, with America's S&P 500 down about 0.7% and Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 ending the day down more than 1.5%.",

        "headline": "Her daughter was taken and sent abroad - 44 years later, they found each other",
        "author": "Juna Moon and Tessa Wong",
        "body": "The last memory Han Tae-soon has of her daughter as a child is in May 1975, at their home in Seoul.\n\"I was going to the market and asked Kyung-ha, 'Aren't you coming?' But she told me, 'No, I'm going to play with my friends',\" recalled Ms Han.\n\"When I came back, she was gone.\"\nMs Han would not see her daughter again for more than four decades. When they reunited, Kyung-ha was almost unrecognisable as a middle-aged American woman named Laurie Bender.\nKyung-ha had been kidnapped near her home, brought to an orphanage, then sent illegally to the US to be raised by another family, alleges Ms Han, who is now suing the South Korean government for failing to prevent her daughter's adoption.\nShe is among the hundreds of people who have come forward in recent years with damning allegations of fraud, illegal adoptions, kidnapping and human trafficking in South Korea's controversial overseas adoption programme.\nNo other country has sent as many children abroad for adoption, and for so long, as South Korea. Since the programme began in the 1950s, about 170,000 to 200,000 children have been adopted overseas - most of them in the West.\nIn March,a landmark inquiryfound that successive governments had committed human rights violations with their lack of oversight, allowing private agencies to \"mass export\" children for profit on an industrial scale.\nExperts say the findings could open the door to more lawsuits against the government. Ms Han's is set to go to court next month.\nIt is one of two landmark cases. Ms Han is the first biological parent of an overseas adoptee seeking damages from the government, while in 2019, a man who was adopted in the US wasthe first adoptee to sue.\nA government spokesman told the BBC that it \"deeply sympathises with the emotional pain of individuals and families who could not find each other for a long time\".\nIt added that it considered Ms Han's case with \"deep regret\" and that it would take \"necessary actions\" based on the outcome of the trial.\nMs Han, 71, told the BBC she is determined the government takes responsibility.\n\"I spent 44 years ruining my body and mind searching for [my daughter]. But in all that time, has anyone ever apologised to me? No one. Not once.\"\nFor decades, she and her husband visited police stations and orphanages, put up flyers, and went on television appealing for information. Ms Han said she spent all day pounding the streets looking for her daughter \"till all 10 of my toenails fell out\".\nOver the years she thought she came close. In 1990, after one of her TV appeals, Ms Han met a woman who she believed could be Kyung-ha, and even took her in to live with her family for a while. But the woman eventually confessed she was not her daughter.\nA breakthrough finally happened in 2019 when Ms Han signed up with325 Kamra, a group that connects overseas Korean adoptees with their birth parents by matching their DNA.\nThey soon reported a match - Laurie Bender, a nurse in California. After several phone calls, she flew over to Seoul to meet Ms Han, where the two had a tearful reunion at the airport.\nAs they embraced, Ms Han ran her fingers through Kyung-ha's hair. \"I've been a hairdresser for 30 years. I can quickly tell if it's my daughter just by feeling her hair. I had mistakenly thought I found her before, so I had to touch and feel the hair to confirm it,\" she said.\nThe first thing she told her daughter was \"I'm so sorry\".\n\"I felt guilty because she couldn't find her way home when she was a child. I kept thinking about how much she must have searched for her mother\u2026 Meeting her after all those years made me realise how much she must have longed for her mother, and it broke my heart.\"\n\"It's like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,\" Kyung-ha said about their reunion in an earlier interview with the Associated Press.  She did not respond to the BBC's requests for an interview.\nThe pair eventually pieced together what happened on that day in May 1975.\nKyung-ha, who was six years old at the time, was playing near her home when she was approached by a strange woman claiming to know her mother. Kyung-ha was told her mother \"didn't need\" her any more and was taken to a train station.\nAfter taking a train ride with the woman, Kyung-ha was abandoned at the final stop, where she was eventually picked up by police officers and placed in an orphanage. Soon, she was flown to the US to be adopted by a couple in Virginia.\nYears later, checks revealed she was given false papers stating she was an abandoned orphan whose parents were unknown.\n\"It's like you've been living a fake life and everything you know is not true,\" Kyung-ha said previously.\nHer case was far from an isolated one.\nSouth Korea's overseas adoption programme began in the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War, when it was a deeply impoverished country with an estimated 100,000 orphaned and displaced children.\nAt that time, few families were willing to adopt non-biological children, and the government began an overseas adoption programme, billed as a humanitarian effort.\nThe programme was handled entirely by private adoption agencies. While they were under government oversight, over time these agencies gained significant autonomy through laws.\nAs their power grew, so did the number of children being sent abroad, rising in the 1970s and peaking in the 1980s. In 1985 alone, more than 8,800 children were sent overseas.\nThere was a massive demand from the West - with declining birth rates and fewer babies to adopt at home, families began seeking children elsewhere.\nPhotos from that era show planes heading to Western countries filled with Korean children, with swaddled babies strapped to seats \u2013 what the truth and reconciliation commission's inquiry called the \"mass transportation of children like cargo\".\nThe report alleges little care was taken of these children during these long flights. In one case it cited from 1974, a lactose-intolerant child was fed milk in transit and subsequently died upon arrival in Denmark.\nCritics of the programme have long questioned why so many children needed to be sent overseas at a time when South Korea was already experiencing rapid economic growth.\nA 1976 BBC Panorama documentary, which featured South Korea as one of several Asian countries sending children to the West, quoted an observer describing the situation as \"out of control\" and \"almost like a trade in children\u2026 flowing from Asia into Europe and North America\".\nAccording to the truth and reconciliation report, foreign adoption agencies set quotas for children, which Korean agencies willingly fulfilled.\nIt was a profitable business - the lack of government regulation allowed the Korean agencies to charge large amounts and demand hidden fees termed as \"donations\".\nSome of these children may have been obtained by unscrupulous means, with parents like Ms Han alleging their children were kidnapped. In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of homeless or unattended children were rounded up and put in orphanages or welfare centres as part of a national campaign to \"clean up the streets\" of South Korea.\nOther parents were told their babies had fallen sick and died, when they were actually alive and taken to adoption agencies. Agencies also did not obtain proper consent from birth mothers to take their children for adoption, according to the truth and reconciliation report.\nThe report also stated that adoption agencies deliberately falsified information in adoption records to cut corners and quickly meet the demand for children.\nLost children who were found without any identity documents would be made to appear, in paperwork, as if they had been abandoned and put up for adoption.\nIf a child intended for adoption had died or was reclaimed by their birth parents, another child would be swapped in and assigned the original child's identity. This allowed agencies to avoid refunding adoption fees and expedite the adoption process.\nDecades on, this has created immense difficulties for many overseas adoptees trying to track down their biological parents.\nSome have wrong or missing information in their adoption records, while others have discovered they were given entirely false identities.\n\"We are victims of state violence but there is no trace of this - literally. This lack of documents must not make us victims for the second time,\" said Han Boon-young, co-founder of an overseas adoptee rights group campaigning for greater access to birth information.\n\"This is a human rights issue. There were kidnappings, falsified documents - all of which were examples of violations committed during the inter-country adoption process.\n\"It is really necessary to move towards reconciliation, that we recognise these experiences, and that the people who committed these violations be held responsible.\"\nBut some of the key players continue to stay silent or deny wrongdoing.\nThe BBC contacted Bu Chung-ha, who in the 1970s served as chairman of Holt International, South Korea's largest adoption agency.\nHolt is at the centre of numerous allegations of fraud and illegal adoptions, and the subject of two lawsuits so far, including Ms Han's.\nIn a brief reply, Mr Bu denied that the agency had sent abroad any children wrongly identified as orphans during his tenure. Any parents alleging their children were kidnapped \"did not lose their children, they abandoned them\", he said.\nThe current management of Holt International has yet to respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nExperts say the responsibility lay not only with the private agencies but also with the state.\n\"Adoption agencies exploited the system, and the government turned a blind eye - allowing illegal practices to take root,\" said Dr Lee Kyung-eun, an international law scholar at Seoul National University.\n\"The government was the captain, and the agencies rowed the boat,\" said Shin Pil-sik, a researcher on transnational adoption at Seokyeong University, who added that this structure enabled both sides to deflect accountability.\nDr Shin said the state was not a passive observer- it actively shaped adoption policy, setting annual quotas for overseas placements and even on occasion halted some  adoptions.\nAn Associated Press news investigation last yearfound successive Korean governments had rewritten laws to remove minimal safeguards and judicial oversight, fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable, and allowed foreign families to adopt Korean children quickly without ever visiting the country.\nWhile the government billed the programme as a humanitarian effort, observers say it also served to strengthen ties with Western countries.\nA 1984 government document obtained by the BBC stated that the official goals of the adoption policy included not only the welfare of children but also \"the promotion of future national strength and people-to-people diplomacy\".\nWhen asked about the state's role in past adoption practices, South Korea's health and welfare ministry said they were \"continuing efforts to strengthen state responsibility\" in the system and that it plans to promote adoptions that comply with international standards.\nIn 2012, the government revised adoption laws to tighten screening of potential adoptive parents, and to track birthparent data and birth information better.\nIt has alsoenacted reforms to the adoption systemensuring that overseas adoptions are minimised and that all adoptions would be handled by the government instead of private agencies. The changes will take effect in July.\nMeanwhile, overseas adoptions have declined. In the late 1980s, overseas adoptions dropped sharply, before stabilising in the 1990s and dropping again in the 2010s. Only 79 children were adopted abroad in 2023, according to the latest available data.\nBut as South Korea begins to address this dark chapter in its past, adoptees and birth parents like Ms Han continue to struggle with their trauma.\nAfter their initial reunion, Ms Han and Kyung-ha have struggled to maintain a close connection.\nNot only do they live on opposite sides of the world, her daughter has forgotten most of her Korean while Ms Han knows little English.\nThey keep in touch over texts occasionally, and Ms Han spends two hours every day practising her English by writing phrases in an exercise book.\nBut it isn't enough for Ms Han.\n\"Even though I have found my daughter, it doesn't feel like I've truly found her. All I know is where she is, but what good is that, if we can't even communicate?\n\"My entire life has been ruined\u2026 no amount of money will ever make up for what I've lost.\"",

        "body": "Several people have suffered life-threatening injuries in a knife attack at the main railway station in the German city of Hamburg, police have said.\nHamburg Police said 18people were injured in the attack at the northern city's Central Station at about 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Friday.\nOfficers arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene as they carried out a major operation.\nThe woman remains in police custody and is scheduled to appear in court on Saturday.\nIn a post on X, Hamburg Police said several people who were hurt had sustained life-threatening injuries.\nSpeaking to the press outside the station, police said they believe the suspect acted alone and did not have a \"political motive\".\nRather, they believe she may have been \"in a state of mental distress,\" Florian Abbenseth, a police spokesperson, told reporters.\nPolice later added that its homicide division is investigating the incident as well as the suspect's motives.\nThe attack happened between platforms 13 and 14 - which are accessible via a busy main road - while a train was on one of the platforms.\nSome of the victims were treated inside trains, according to reports.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack was \"shocking\" and thanked the emergency services on the ground for \"their rapid assistance\".\nGerman rail operator Deutsche Bahn said four platforms at the station were closed and some services would experience delays and diversions.\nPictures from the scene show a number of emergency service personnel and vehicles on the ground, and barriers that seem to be hiding the injured from public view.\nOne photograph used by German media shows a man being taken away by paramedics on a stretcher.\nA video on social media appears to show the suspect with her hands behind her back being escorted out of the station platform by officers who put her in a police vehicle.\nHamburg Central Station is one of Germany's busiest transport hubs, with more than 550,000 travellers per day according to its website. It is often crowded during Friday rush hour.\nThis is the latest in a series of violent attacks in Germany in recent months.\nIn January, a two-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man werekilled in a stabbing in a park in Aschaffenburg, with several others hurt.\nA Spanish tourist wasstabbed just a month later at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial.\nLast December, six people were killed and hundreds were injured aftera car drove into a crowd at a Christmas marketin the eastern city of Magdeburg.\nThe suspects in these previous attacks were migrants, which has ledGermany to tighten border control checksand saw immigration become a key issue for voters during the country's federal elections in February.",

        "headline": "As Israel faces diplomatic 'tsunami', Trump is staying quiet",
        "author": "Paul Adams",
        "body": "A headline in Israel's liberal daily Ha'aretz this week put it starkly: \"Diplomatic tsunami nears,\" it warned, \"as Europe begins to act against Israel's 'complete madness' in Gaza.\"\nThis week's diplomatic assault has taken many forms, not all of them foreseen.\nFrom concerted international condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza, to the shocking murder of two young Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, this has been, to put it mildly, a tumultuous week for the Jewish state.\nThe waves started crashing on Israel's shores on Monday evening, when Britain, France and Canada issued a joint statement condemning its \"egregious\" actions in Gaza.\nAll three warned of the possibility of \"further concrete actions\" if Israel continued its renewed military offensive and failed to lift restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nThey also threatened \"targeted sanctions\" in response to Israel's settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.\nA statement from 24 donor nations followed, condemning a new, Israeli-backed aid delivery model for Gaza.\nBut that was just the start.\nOn Tuesday, Britain suspended trade talks with Israel and said a 2023 road map for future cooperation was being reviewed.\nA fresh round of sanctions was imposed on Jewish settlers, including Daniela Weiss, a prominent figure who featured in Louis Theroux's recent documentary, The Settlers.\nIsrael's ambassador in London, Tzipi Hotovely, was summoned to the Foreign Office, a move generally reserved for the representatives of countries like Russia and Iran.\nTo make matters worse for Israel, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said a \"strong majority\" of the bloc's members favoured reviewing the 25-year-old Association Agreement with Israel.\nThe reasons for this flurry of diplomatic condemnation seemed clear enough.\nEvidence that Gaza was closer to mass starvation than at any time since the war began, following Hamas's attack in October 2023, was sending ripples of horror across the world.\nIsrael's military offensive, and the rhetoric surrounding it, suggested that conditions in the stricken territory were about to deteriorate once more.\nAddressing MPs on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy singled out the words of Israel's hardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who had spoken of \"cleansing\" Gaza, \"destroying what's left\" and relocating the civilian population to third countries.\n\"We must call this what it is,\" Lammy said. \"It's extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous. And I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\"\nSmotrich is not a decision-maker when it comes to conduct of the war in Gaza. Before now, his incendiary remarks might have been set to one side.\nBut those days appear to be over. Rightly or wrongly, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seen as in thrall to his far-right colleagues. Critics accuse him of relentlessly pursuing a war, without regard for the lives of Palestinian civilians or the remaining Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.\nCountries that have long supported Israel's right to defend itself are beginning to say \"enough is enough.\"\nThis week was clearly a significant moment for Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, a staunch defender of Israel (he once said \"I support Zionism without qualification\") who faced strong criticism from within the Labour Party for his reluctance last year to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nOn Tuesday, Sir Keir said the suffering of innocent children in Gaza was \"utterly intolerable\".\nIn the face of this unusually concerted action from some of his country's strongest allies, Netanyahu reacted furiously, suggesting Britain, France and Canada were guilty of supporting Hamas.\n\"When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice,\" he posted on X.\n\"You're on the wrong side of humanity and you're on the wrong side of history.\"\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar went further, suggesting there was a \"direct line\" between Israel's critics, including Starmer, and Wednesday night's killing of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, the two Israeli embassy employees gunned down outside the Jewish Museum in Washington.\nBut despite the outpourings of sympathy following the shooting, the Israeli government seems increasingly isolated, with western allies and prominent members of the Jewish diaspora all voicing anger \u2013 and anguish \u2013 over the war in Gaza.\nLord Levy, former Middle East envoy and advisor to Tony Blair, said he endorsed the current government's criticisms, even suggesting they might have come \"a little late\".\n\"There has to be a stand, not just from us in this country but internationally, against what is going on in Gaza,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One, describing himself as \"a very proud Jew\u2026who passionately cares for Israel\".\nBut silent, throughout all this, is the one man who could, if he wanted, stop the war.\nAt the end of his recent tour of the Gulf, Donald Trump said \"a lot of people are starving\".\nWhite House officials indicated the US president was frustrated with the war and wanted the Israeli government to \"wrap it up\".\nBut while other western leaders release expressions of outrage, Trump is saying almost nothing.",

        "headline": "Yachts easy way to bring in migrants - ex-smuggler",
        "author": "Annabel Deas, Hayley Mortimer and Kirstie Brewer",
        "body": "A former British soldier who became a people smuggler has told the BBC how he transported dozens of Vietnamese migrants by yacht into private marinas in seaside towns across south-east England.\nThe man was convicted and sent to prison in 2019, but we have learned that smugglers are still using similar routes and methods - described by Border Force as \"a really concerning risk\".\nPrivate marinas have \"no more security than a caravan site\", one harbourmaster on the Essex coast told us - while another said \"there is nothing to stop this [people smuggling] happening\".\nThe ex-soldier and smuggler, who we are calling Nick, has also been describing how he smuggled Albanian people in cars on to ferries - and how the migrants then jumped into lorries on the vehicle decks mid-journey in the English Channel.\nThe smuggling routes - whether by yacht or ferry - were \"easy\" and \"low risk\", Nick told us.\nHe said he had chosen to speak out now because he was \"angry\" he had been jailed for a crime that was still very possible to commit. He claimed to know people who, in the past year, had used the same routes and methods as him.\nConvicting him was \"pointless\", he said, if the authorities would not improve security to stop other people smugglers.\nBorder Force is responsible for securing the 11,000 miles of UK coastline, but the security of harbours and marinas rests with private operators, Charlie Eastaugh, the force's director of maritime, told the BBC.\n\"We patrol 24/7, we carry out proactive, as well as reactive, operations,\" he said - citing a luxury yacht, hiding 20 Albanians below deck, that was intercepted en route to Newquay in Cornwall last month.\nNick's story is a particularly striking example of how a British citizen became involved in the international people-smuggling trade.\nHis \"stories and confessions represent a concerning risk posed to the UK around people smuggling and irregular migration at sea\", said Border Force's Charlie Eastaugh. We will \"look at the vulnerabilities he [Nick] has identified,\" he added.\nUnlike many migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, the majority of those transported by Nick did not want to be found by authorities to formally claim asylum. Having arrived on UK shores, they wanted to disappear anonymously into the black economy. Nick said he had been told the Vietnamese migrants would go on to work on cannabis farms.\nThe fact that Nick travelled with them too - skippering a yacht - is also unusual.\nIt all started in 2009, when an Albanian friend he met on a construction site recruited him - saying Nick's pale complexion and UK passport would help him to avoid suspicion from border authorities.\nThe friend, whom we are calling Matt, offered to pay Nick \u00a33,500 for every migrant he smuggled into the UK. Nick was working as a self-employed builder at the time, but his business had been pulled under by the financial crash in the late 2000s and he was struggling to make ends meet. He also had a baby on the way and was desperate to provide for them, he told us.\nMatt spoke briefly to the BBC and confirmed details of Nick's story - but we did not move forward with a full interview because he demanded payment.\nAt first, Nick picked up migrants hiding near French ferry ports, concealing them in the boot of his car.\nThe migrants tended to be Albanian men, he told us, with no right to work in the UK. Often they had been smuggled across the English Channel three or four times previously, only to be deported each time, he added. Some of his other passengers, from places such as Sri Lanka, were looking to claim asylum however, he told us.\nOn the ferry, Nick would pick a lorry that another smuggling-gang member waiting on dry land would spot easily. Nick said he would send them a photo and share the vehicle's number plate.\nYou then tell the migrant to get on top of the lorry, he explained. \"You give him a knife\u2026 just cut one side like a V, you slide in.\"\nThe waiting gang member would then trail the lorry once it disembarked and collect the migrant when it eventually stopped. The lorry driver would have had no idea or involvement, said Nick.\n\"I'm telling you now how easy it is,\" he told us - insisting he would never have been caught, had it not been for a friend, whom he had taken along one day, alerting the French authorities with suspicious body language. Nick ended up spending five months in a prison in France.\nMatt, meanwhile, was also eventually caught and given a seven-year UK prison sentence. It had happened after a migrant jumped off a fast-moving lorry, to avoid paying the smuggler, and severed his foot.\nNick was reunited with Matt, who was granted early release, in 2017 and the pair began smuggling people across the Channel again.\nThis time however, Nick told us he took charge of a plan that saw Vietnamese migrants arrive from France by yacht at Ramsgate Marina.\nThe operation was brokered by one of Matt's contacts, Nick told us, a Vietnamese woman we are calling Lin. She had lived in the UK for more than a decade and had spent time behind bars for growing cannabis and removing the proceeds of drug trafficking.\nNick said she paid him and Matt \u00a312,000 per migrant.\nNick, who grew up sailing the English Channel with his father, told us he knew Ramsgate Marina was a big, low-security place which \"no-one watched\". As he was a registered member of the marina, there was no reason for anyone to suspect wrongdoing, he explained.\nIt was also a good place to keep tabs on the comings and goings of Border Force agents, he told us, because a fleet of the force's boats was based there too.\n\"People are going to hate me because there'll be smuggling going on now,\" said Nick, who insists private marinas in English seaside towns are still hotspots. \"When they hear this, there's going to be an issue.\"\nTwo harbourmasters, speaking anonymously to the BBC, agreed with Nick that private marinas were an easy target for people-smugglers because they were not manned 24/7.\nOne based in Essex likened security to a caravan site and said that someone could hide people in a boat \"easily\".\n\"In a busy marina in peak season, with a lot of people coming in and out, it would be very easy to do this,\" they said.\nIn Kent, Thanet District Council - which is responsible for Ramsgate Marina - told us it was Border Force, and not individual harbours, that was \"the front line response for immigration and illegal activities\".\n\"Staff at the port and harbour are vigilant and report any concerns or suspicions directly to Border Force for them to follow up,\" said a spokesperson.\nThere are hundreds of harbours and marinas in the UK and it would not be a reasonable expectation for Border Force to have a fixed presence at all of them, said the force's Charlie Eastaugh.\nBut we do receive \"really good information\" from the maritime community which the force responds to, he added. \"We need to be able to respond to intelligence so we can proportionately use our resources around the whole of the UK.\"\nWe also spoke to former Border Force chief Tony Smith, who told us the \"vast majority\" of the agency's resources were currently deployed to the Small Boats Operational Command - focusing on specific routes used by large numbers of people crowded into small craft.\n\"My preference certainly would be to be able to deploy more widely and to look more across the whole of the UK coastline to identify threats,\" he said, adding he thought the BBC's conversations with Nick would be \"really, really helpful as another source of intelligence\".\nMore than 12,500 people have crossed the English Channel on small boats so far in 2025 - anda record number of migrants diedwhile attempting to make the dangerous crossing in 2024.\nSmall-boat crossings are different from what Nick was doing because most of those migrants want to be seen and rescued by Border Force to claim asylum in the UK. Smugglers are not on the boats, which are instead often manned by migrants who get discounts on their fees.\nThe numbers of migrants involved in an operation like Nick's are harder to pin down because there are no published estimates of how many illegal immigrants enter the UK through small ports, marinas and harbours.\nNick told us he would carefully plan his trips to France around favourable tides and weather conditions - setting sail from Kent after dark. He would head for private marinas, yacht clubs and other discreet locations around Dunkirk to collect the Vietnamese migrants who had been driven from a Paris safehouse. He would normally smuggle four per trip, he said.\nHe would return back to Ramsgate in the early hours before it got light, he told us. The migrants would stay hidden inside the boat's cabin until the next evening, when one of the smuggling gang would collect them under the cover of darkness.\nBut there were occasions when he had to escape prying eyes, Nick recalled. For a time, he had to switch from Ramsgate to a different marina because one of the harbour staff told him there had been \"foreigners\" around his boat, having spotted some of the Vietnamese migrants.\nHe managed to continue his ruse, however, for up to 18 months before being caught.\nA police unit tasked with tackling serious organised crime had been watching him and Matt for months. In late summer 2018, officers spotted Nick sail into view with four Vietnamese men in his boat. Nick was charged with conspiracy to facilitate the illegal entry of foreign nationals into the UK and later sentenced to eight years in prison.\nLin, the Vietnamese woman who had been paying him, got the same sentence. They both denied the charges, whereas Matt, the Albanian, pled guilty and was given a lesser sentence of five years and four months.\n\"I regret a lot of it, but I don't know that it would have ever been any different,\" said Nick, reflecting on his time in the people-smuggling trade.\n\"I think I was always out for self-destruction anyway.\"\nHe was recently recalled to prison for breaching the terms of his licence. Matt and Lin, meanwhile, are both out of prison and living in the UK.",

        "headline": "Hectic two weeks leaves Russia confident - and peace in Ukraine feeling no closer",
        "author": "Steve Rosenberg",
        "body": "It's 2:30am.\nInside the Kremlin walls I'm wandering alone through the vast grounds trying - and failing - to find my way out.\nI spot a checkpoint, approach and show my passport.\n\"Nyet vykhoda!\" [\"No exit!\"] replies the guard. He points in the opposite direction.\nI walk back and, eventually, come to another checkpoint.\n\"No way out!\" says the sentry.\nI'm lost. Inside the Kremlin. In the dead of night.\nIt's like being in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel.\nIt's been quite an evening. I arrived at 5pm. Along with a small group of journalists, I'd been invited to \"an event with President Putin\". What kind of event? To begin with the Kremlin wouldn't say. Eventually we were told Vladimir Putin would be taking questions.\nEight hours later, the president strode into the Malachite Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace and sat at a desk.\nBut there'd been a change of plan. No press conference. No questions. Instead, live on Russian TV, Putin delivered a statement in which he proposed direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.\nEvent over, I walk out of the Kremlin Palace but take a wrong turn. Finally, I locate the correct exit and, bleary-eyed, take a taxi home.\nThis was the start of what has turned out to be a real rollercoaster of a fortnight. What began with a late-night Kremlin statement continued with peace talks in Turkey and then a two-hour telephone call between Putin and Donald Trump.\nBut, at the end of it, are we any closer to peace in Ukraine?\nIt doesn't feel like it.\nAlthough there is talk about more talks, and of \u0430 possible future \"memorandum\" on a \"possible future peace\", it all sounds rather vague.\nFor now, the fighting goes on.\nRussia is still refusing to sign up to an unconditional comprehensive ceasefire. It has no intention of returning any of the Ukrainian land it has seized, occupied and claims to have annexed. On the contrary: it's pushing for more.\nRight now, the Ukraine peace process resembles being lost in the Kremlin late at night.\nIt's hard to see the exit.\nAnd yet the past two weeks have revealed a lot.\nFirst, how Russia neutralises potential threats and pressure points.\nKremlin critics would put this another way: how Russia plays for time.\nOn 10 May (a few hours before I got lost in the Kremlin), after a phone call with Donald Trump, European leaders had issued an ultimatum to President Putin: agree to an unconditional long-term ceasefire in Ukraine in two days or face crushing new sanctions.\nSince March the Trump administration has been calling on Russia and Ukraine to accept a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire. Kyiv agreed. Moscow hasn't.\nThe Kremlin leader sidestepped the European ultimatum with his counter proposal of direct talks in Turkey. The idea was greeted with scepticism in Ukraine and across Europe. But it was enough to placate Trump and convince him Russia was serious about wanting peace. He was all for the talks. \"Crushing\" new sanctions were delayed.\nAhead of the Istanbul meeting on 16 May, President Trump gave the impression that Vladimir Putin might attend. The Kremlin leader did not, sending instead a comparatively low-level delegation that once more rejected the idea of a long-term ceasefire. But, again, the modest results of the talks were sufficient to persuade the US president that progress was being made.\nThen came the Trump-Putin phone call on 19 May.\nBy the end of it, Russia had still not agreed to an immediate comprehensive cessation of hostilities. Instead, according to President Trump, \"Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War\".\nBut Moscow is already casting doubt on whether it would sign any future peace treaty with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For a year now the Russian authorities have been attempting to delegitimise Ukraine's president since the expiry of his presidential term. However, Ukraine's Constitution prohibits the holding of elections in wartime.\nAnd the reason for martial law in Ukraine is Russia's invasion.\n\"Would Russia sit down and sign a peace agreement with President Zelensky?\" I asked Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday.\n\"You're putting the cart before the horse,\" Mr Lavrov replied. \"First we need to have a deal. When it's agreed, then we will decide. But, as President Putin has said many times, President Zelensky does not have legitimacy\u2026 Probably the best option would be new elections\u2026\"\nThe Russian media has concluded that, after two weeks of diplomacy, Moscow has strengthened its hand.\n\"Russia has won the latest round of global poker,\" declared the Izvestia newspaper last week.\n\"Donald Trump's stance couldn't be more advantageous to Moscow,\" wrote Kommersant. \"In effect he backed Russia's position of 'Talks first, ceasefire later' and refused to strengthen sanctions against Russia.\"\nA social scientist told Kommersant: \"Donald Trump, at least for now, is our ideological partner on certain issues. His views are much closer to Russia's than to Europe's.\"\nAnd the ultra pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda had this message for European leaders:\n\"You were warned. Don't wave threats and ultimatums in the face of the bear. Don't try to impose conditions in talks that have nothing to do with you.\n\"Just sit in the lobby and breathe in the smell of the new world order.\"\nMoscow's confidence is also fuelled by the belief that, in Ukraine, it holds the initiative on the battlefield.\nBack in 2023 Donald Trump had promised that, if he won the presidency, \"we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled\u2026 I'll get them both. I know Zelensky, I know Putin. It'll be done within 24 hours, you watch\".\nTrump has been in the Oval Office for more than four months now, but the \"horrible war\" goes on.\nOn rare occasions, he has publicly rebuked the Kremlin and threatened further sanctions. Last month he said: \"\u2026there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?'\"\nBut there's been no follow-through. The US president appears reluctant to ratchet up the pressure on the Kremlin, instead signalling to Moscow that he's keen to reboot US-Russia relations.\nFollowing the presidents' telephone conversation, Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, who'd sat in on the call, told journalists: \"Trump spoke rather emotionally about the prospects for [bilateral] relations. Trump sees Russia as one of America's most important partners in trade and economic matters.\"\nPresident Trump seems determined to push on with his rapprochement with Russia, whatever happens on Ukraine.\nAnd Moscow senses that.\n\"President Trump does not link continued US-Russia dialogue to the Ukraine peace process,\" was a headline in the Russian government paper Rossiyskaya Gazeta this week.\nThat doesn't mean the Kremlin has headed off the danger of additional restrictions completely. The US Senate has threatened tough new sanctions against Russia if Moscow doesn't get serious about diplomacy.\nUp to this point the Kremlin has been able to deflect or to sidestep whatever pressure it's come under to make compromises and concessions regarding its war on Ukraine.\nIt seems confident it will continue to do so.",

        "body": "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and his delegation went to Washington this week hoping for a boost and a reset after months of acrimony with the Donald Trump administration.\nInstead they got brutal, high-stakes diplomacy, peppered with insults, and played out to millions across the world in real time. It was like a painful job review carried out by a boss on a loud hailer.\nPraised by many for remaining composed and reconciliatory in the face of an exercised Trump, while also criticised by some for not responding more forcefully to Tump's accusations, reality awaits Ramaphosa back in South Africa where he and his African National Congress (ANC) face pressures on multiple fronts.\nThe ANC has been in an uneasy coalition - or government of national unity (GNU) - with 10 other parties for almost a year, forced into sharing power after dismal results in national elections.\nThere have been public fights between parties inside and outside the coalition over controversial land and healthcare legislation and attempts to push a budget through parliament which would hike taxes for the most vulnerable. That almost saw the end of the coalition earlier this year.\nThe economy is stagnating, crime rates are sky-high as is corruption and unemployment, public services are largely dysfunctional and infrastructure is crumbling. There also seems to be very little accountability for those who break the law.\nThis has meant uncomfortable and intense questions about Ramaphosa's policies by various political parties, as well as civil society.\nMeanwhile the ANC itself is unstable, as opposing factions begin jockeying for position ahead of a crucial elective conference in 2027 which is likely to see a new party leader emerge.\nAt the same time, Ramaphosa's loudest critics, such as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema - who featured prominently in Trump's discredited dossier of \"evidence\" that genocide was being committed against white Afrikaners in South Africa - as well as former President Jacob Zuma, have been getting louder still.\nSo Ramaphosa was looking for a trade deal, desperately needing the business and stability this would bring to South Africa to stimulate real and lasting economic growth and put people back to work.\nRamaphosa said as much to Trump on Wednesday - that US investment was needed to help tackle the joblessness that was a key factor in the country's high crime rate.\nThe risk that theAgoa trade deal with the USmay not be renewed later this year because of Trump's isolationist worldview have made this all the more urgent. This gave South Africa duty-free access to the US market for certain goods, and is credited with having boosted South Africa's fragile economy.\nBut the talk of trade was overshadowed by Trump's Oval Office ambush over discredited claims that white South Africans were being persecuted.\nHowever, there may still be a silver lining for Ramaphosa, and by extension his party, at least domestically.\nYes, the to-do list is impossibly long, and yes the pressure for the South African president to hold a coalition and party together that is messy and deeply uncomfortable will be waiting for him on his return. And yes the ANC is in the weakest position since it came to power 30 years ago. But it's still in power, even if it's sharing it.\nCrucially, Ramaphosa's conduct with Trump reminded South Africans of his diplomatic pedigree, and of his importance to the country's rules-based order.\nHe is, along with Nelson Mandela, South Africa's greatest ever alliance builder and facilitator. He was at the nerve centre of negotiating an end to the racist system of apartheid in the early 1990s, and in keeping South Africa together when many had prophesised its fatal fracture. He has stayed calm, smiled and faced down far more bitter opponents before.\nMore recently, he steered the country out of the bleak\"state capture\"years of the Zuma administration and then through the difficult Covid lockdowns. And also kept the ANC on its feet - just - when it hobbled home after the 2024 elections. He then he took a wounded ANC into coalition politics and survived as president despite opposition from within his own party.\n\"I believe if a snap poll was done today, we would see his personal ratings go up,\" says South African editor and founder of explain.co.za Verashni Pillay.\n\"He excels in these high-pressure situations. He has this wealth of negotiating experience in arguably far more tense environments where there has been actual blood on the streets and imminent civil war. That's why you saw him looking particularly relaxed. He's masterful at diffusing tension at key moments.\"\nSurveys have consistently referenced the Ramaphosa Effect - themost recentfrom the Social Research Foundation last month which suggests that without him, the ANC would haemorrhage support even more than it already has, despite equally consistent criticism of the South African president that he is too slow and indecisive in tackling the country's biggest problems. To a large extent, that's still the case.\nBut events this week, ostensibly meant to bully, ridicule and embarrass Ramaphosa around the world, actually reminded many South Africans of what he brings to the government and the country - a constant, stable and predictable centre.\n\"I think what happened in the Oval Office has reinforced the idea of 'If not Ramaphosa then who?'\" says Pillay.\nIn fact, some think that what South Africans saw in the White House will actually strengthen the GNU - backed as it is by big business, which will ultimately reassure South Africans who were watching the drama.\n\"The meeting displayed a united front from South Africa, a public-private performance that the country has been promoting for over a decade. This for the GNU is great political theatre that translates into political capital,\" says Itumeleng Makgetla, a political analyst at the University of Pretoria.\nAnd indeed, the optics were all there. Ramaphosa facilitated a passionate rebuttal of the worst of Trump's misinformation through interventions from his partner in the GNU - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen - and one of South Africa's wealthiest people, Johann Rupert - both white South Africans. If Trump understood the power of performance, so too did Ramaphosa.\n\"I do think the GNU comes out of this looking quite strong,\" says Pillay. \"The GNU happened at a really good moment for South Africa ahead of this crisis. If it was just the ANC government in the room, [Ramaphosa's arguments] wouldn't have landed. But being able to say that we have these parties that represent white people in government is such a strong statement.\"\nSo what does this all mean for those on the extreme flanks of South African politics and discourse?\nAfter the lights dimmed, Julius Malema was shown by Trump singing a song that some say calls for the murder of white farmers, although a court has ruled it is just political rhetoric. Might he reap domestic political capital from being thrust into the global spotlight?\nYes, say some. \"For those in the country that are quite tired of the diatribe from President Trump and the US\u2026 this will likely strengthen Malema [and] parties like the MK because it'll basically be saying: 'Look, surely we can't be bending over backwards for such individuals and lies,'\" says South African political analyst Prof Kagiso \"TK\" Pooe from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\nBut Pillay disagrees.\n\"This will not translate into political power for Malema.  Most of his top leaders have alreadydefected to Jacob Zuma's MK party. Things for the EFF were not looking good, even before Wednesday. Julius Malema's brand of politics, of wanting everything to burn down, of blaming white people for everything... is entertaining but it hasn't won votes because most South Africans don't want their country to be burnt down.\"\nHaving said that, there is a sizeable group of South Africans who want faster and more radical change - the election results for the MK party, a breakaway faction of the ANC, shows that.\nAnd what of Afriforum - the Afrikaner interest group that tugged at the ears of Trump's supporters for a number of years by lobbying and spreading right-wing propaganda, hoping to be heard?\nTrump's discredited audio-visual presentation of what he said was the systematic extermination of white Afrikaner farmers was the high-water mark of their lobbying efforts, amplified as they were in the Oval Office.\nYet, despite extraordinarily high levels of violent crime in South Africa, many are angry at the group. \"In a way, I think a lot of South Africans - even those that don't support the ANC - can finally see that there are certain people that are not for South Africa. Those people have been singled out and that's a positive in a way,\" says Prof Pooe.\n\"We know a large number of Afrikaans speakers are people of colour,\" says Pillay. \"Afriforum dealt a severe blow to the cause of Afrikaners in South Africa by racialising it.\"\nAfriforum's Kallie Kriel has defended the group's conduct on a local television channel, Newzroom Afrika: \"It wasn't Afriforum chanting genocidal calls for someone to be killed. If President Ramaphosa went there to tell the Americans that they don't know what's going on, they will see that as an insult because they have an embassy in South Africa and a State Department and intelligence services,\" he said.\nAs the dust settles from Wednesday's drama, Ramaphosa will be watching and calculating. He has consistently been at the centre of key inflection points in recent South African history when some kind of a rupture has occurred and the country has had to change course dramatically. He reads these moments so well.\nWednesday's upheaval in Trump's White House may not have been the economic and diplomatic reset with the US that was hoped, but could yet mark a dramatic reset for Ramaphosa and the GNU with the South African public.\nAdditional reporting by Khanyisile Ngcobo in Johannesburg\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica",

A portion of the vessel appears to be on land.\nAn official investigation into the accident - which Kim described as a \"criminal act\" - has begun, state media reported on Friday.\nNone of the reports mentioned any casualties or injuries as a result of Thursday's incident in the eastern port city of Chongjin.\nKCNA, North Korea's official news agency, downplayed the damage in a report on Friday, saying it was \"not serious\" and that, contrary to initial reports, there were no holes on the ship's bottom.\n\"The hull starboard was scratched and a certain amount of seawater flowed into the stern section through the rescue channel,\" KCNA reported.\nThe manager of the shipyard, Hong Kil Ho, has been summoned by law enforcers, it said.\nIt would take around 10 days to restore the destroyer's side, according to KCNA.\nKim said on Thursday that the accident was caused by \"absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism\".\nHe added that those who made \"irresponsible errors\" will be dealt with at a plenary meeting next month.\nIt's not clear what punishment they might face, but the authoritarian state has a woeful human rights record.\nIt is uncommon for North Korea to publicly disclose local accidents - though it has done this a handful of times in the past.\nThis particular accident comes weeks after North Korea unveiled a similar 5,000-ton destroyer, the Choe Hyon.\nKim had called that warship a \"breakthrough\" in modernising North Korea's navy and said it would be deployed early next year.",
